(2) I am unable to extract predicted probabilities from the model. I see a function called ""predict_proba"" but have had no luck with it. When I run it, I get ""'AdversarialDebiasing' object has no attribute 'predict_proba'"". However, the ""predict' function for class labels works just fine.

Hi, I'm a PhD student from Politecnico di Bari, Italy;
I was reproducing this algorithm following the paper and the AIF360 implementation but not all is equal to the paper. At page 6 the authors says: 
""Without tweaking, this algorithm ran into issues with local minima, and the resulting models were often closer to
demographic parity than equality of odds. We implemented
a technique that helped: by increasing the hyperparameter α
in Eqn. 1 over time, the predictor had a much easier time
learning to deceive the adversary and therefore more strictly
enforce equality of odds. We set α =
√
t (where t is the step
counter), and to avoid divergence we set the predictor’s step
size to η ∝ 1/t""
I think the term self.adversary_loss_weight should be update in each iteration as equal to sqrt(epoch) (for epoch in range(self.num_epochs)).","2021-11-02 13:57:36","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/276"

And then log(0) not defined.

Shouldn't the package have a class which does not use BinaryLabelDataset for predictions, in order to calculate a Theil Indez with a continous score instead of a binary score?

I assume it is using the trick a*log(a) is equals to log(a**a), but not sure Theil Index is supposed to be calculated that way.

I did not expected this implementation, looks like a trick to be able to have the same interface for all metrics, instead of the proper calculation.

> ""The AI Fairness 360 toolkit is an open-source library to help detect and remove bias in machine learning models. The AI Fairness 360 Python package includes a comprehensive set of metrics for datasets and models to test for biases, explanations for these metrics, and algorithms to mitigate bias in datasets and models.""

While it's clear that we intend Bias in this context to meant ""prejudice"" or a disproportionate skew towards something, we must consider the larger impacts of this perspective. First off, it is impossible to not be prejudiced. In the social sciences, we call this ""subjectivity"". While some disciplines treat ""objectivity"" as an ideal, this concept is not transferable to human behavior, which is what we are modeling in our software applications. All humans have a distinct perspective, therefore all humans are prejudiced in some way.

The data & software applications that AIF360 seeks to ""de-bias"" were made by people based on their assumptions about how the world works & what they think matters. A software application is one group of people's collective opinion about what their stakeholders need. The structure of the software itself is based on these people's experience & is therefore prejudiced. For example, efforts like [Gendermag](https://gendermag.org/) & [A11y](https://a11yproject.com/) are helping people working in open source projects address assumptions about how their stakeholders are using their software tools at a very fundamental level.

When training data is both curated & labeled, assumptions are made by the curators & it's clear from the description of the project that this is what AIF360 can help to address. However we must also acknowledge that AIF360 is also prejudiced by the assumptions of its creators & maintainers, & therefore can neither remove bias nor de-bias.

What is ""fair"" & ""correct"" is highly situational. What is ""fair"" in one situation may not be ""fair"" in another. In some social situations, such as in Law Enforcement, the lack of fairness is indicative of larger social issues & ""de-biasing"" could potentially further harm disadvantaged stakeholders who have been excluded from having their own voice. We should assume such deviations on ""fairness"" to be the norm, not an aberration. This assumption of a universal ideal norm (or bias if you will) exists within AIF360 itself.

I suggest we reconsider that bias & prejudice are tied to something inherent in the human condition & are therefore unavoidable. Instead of a definition that dictates our own biased ""Truth"" through the removal of any non-conforming perspectives, I propose we re-define bias as simply ""limited perspective"" & re-evaluate our language & explanations from that starting point.

This issue is quite significant because our framing of ""bias"" presents potential harms to IBM's own credibility & intention. IBM has historically had moments where we were very narrow & short-sighted in our contribution to software projects. The global scale of our Thought-Leadership & influence meant our mistakes significantly impacted people's lives. That said, for all the harms we've done, we achieve great things too! [IBM has the advantage of having a much longer-term history than other tech companies to draw upon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxpuU6baGqY) Given the scale of our potential impact, we have a corporate social responsibility to thoughtfully consider who is at stake when we bring new ideas into the world. 

### ""To visualize the future of IBM, you must know something of the past"" -Thomas J. Watson, Sr.

- IBM worked with the NYPD post-9/11 to develop surveillance software that lets police search by skin color [https://theintercept.com/2018/09/06/nypd-surveillance-camera-skin-tone-search/](https://theintercept.com/2018/09/06/nypd-surveillance-camera-skin-tone-search/)

“Now, thanks to confidential corporate documents and interviews with many of the technologists involved in developing the software, The Intercept and the Investigative Fund have learned that IBM began developing this object identification technology using secret access to NYPD camera footage. With access to images of thousands of unknowing New Yorkers offered up by NYPD officials, as early as 2012, IBM was creating new search features that allow other police departments to search camera footage for images of people by hair color, facial hair, and skin tone.”

- That time when IBM helped Indiana kick people off [Welfare](https://www.thenation.com/article/want-cut-welfare-theres-app/)

“In November 2006, Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels announced a 10-year, $1.16 billion contract with a consortium of tech companies, led by IBM and Affiliated Computer Services (ACS), to modernize and privatize eligibility procedures for the state’s Medicaid, food-stamp, and cash-assistance programs.”

“The design of electronic-governance systems affects our material well-being, the health of our democracy, and equity in our communities. But somehow, when we talk about data-driven government, we conveniently omit the often terrible impacts that these systems have on the poor and working-class people”

"https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360","issue","386456140","make estimators and scorers sklearn compatible The `inprocessing` algorithms are basically like an `Estimator`. Ideally, it should be possible to replace a classifier in a scikit-learn pipeline, with one from aif360. An example pipeline (taken from [this](https://github.com/adrinjalali/aif360_tutorial/blob/master/building_fair_AI_models.ipynb) example) looks like:

```
model = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(),
                      LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear'))
X_train = meps_orig_train.features
y_train = meps_orig_train.labels.ravel()

model_lr = model.fit(X_train, y_train,
                     **{""logisticregression__sample_weight"":meps_orig_train.instance_weights})
```

But when we move to use a model such as `PrejudiceRemover`, we have to break the pipeline and have the model separate, since it doesn't follow the API requirements to be fit for a pipeline.

```
model = PrejudiceRemover(sensitive_attr=sens_attr, eta = 25.0)
scale = StandardScaler().fit(tr_dataset.features)

tr_dataset.features = scale.transform(tr_dataset.features)
model.fit(tr_dataset)
```

Once it can be fit in a pipeline, then we can use all the other mechanisms already available in sklearn, such as `GridSearchCV` to find best hyperparameters for the problem at hand.

That also brings are to the scorers. AIF36's scorers also don't fit into the scoring mechanism of sklearn. Once they do, we could use functions such as [`make_scorer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#defining-your-scoring-strategy-from-metric-functions) to create a scoring function and feed it into the sklearn's `GridSearchCV` for instance.

This may not be a trivial task, and some useful things such as having multiple scoring functions recorded and reported by the grid search are still in discussion and not yet available in sklearn. Until then, we can provide an easy way for the users to combine antibias scoring functions with performance scoring ones and use them to choose their best pipeline.

Another point regarding the API conventions is that if the `preprocessing` modules also fit in the `sklearn.Pipeline` as a transformer, then we can put their selection also in a hyperparameter search and do the search much easier than having to manually run them one by one and going through them to find the best solution.

Right now transformers which would change the number of samples or change the output are not supported in sklearn (AFAIK), but that's also in discussion and this usecase may be a good push for it.","2018-12-01 12:58:22","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/58"

I know github's editor's max line is 127, but that's far too long for easily reviewing PRs on different systems and screens. I think it may make more sense to change that to 80 (what PEP8 recommends, with convincing arguments), and since we don't want to have to fix what already is in the repo, we can try and enforce that on new code.

The parameters are passed to `MetricFrame` using `sample_params`. I found that for built-in metrics with `sample_weight` and `pos_label` as extra parameters, `sample_weight` is always working well, but when `pos_label` was passed with a not-None value, it produced IndexError from fairlearn/metrics/_function_container.py. I've tried all *_rate metrics imported from fairlearn.metrics, like `false_positive_rate`, and also similar metrics imported from sklearn.metrics, like `recall_score`. All behaved similarly. 

Here is the minimal code to reproduce, and I am using fairlearn 0.7.0

```
import fairlearn.metrics as flm
from fairlearn.metrics import MetricFrame
y_true = [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
y_pred = [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
gp = ['d', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'c',
                         'b', 'd', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'd', 'c', 'c']
sample_weight = [0.1]*len(y_true) 
pos_label = 1
print(flm.false_positive_rate(y_true, y_pred, sample_weight, pos_label))
gm = MetricFrame(metrics=flm.false_positive_rate,
                             y_true=y_true,
                             y_pred=y_pred,
                             sensitive_features=gp,
                sample_params={'sample_weight': sample_weight, 'pos_label': pos_label})
print(gm.overall)
```

The above code will print 0.666666 for the direct computation by calling the metric function, and throw error when using in MetricFrame. The last part of the error message is: 
```
/home/cdsw/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/fairlearn/metrics/_function_container.py in generate_sample_params_for_mask(self, mask)

     85         return curr_sample_params
     86 

IndexError: too many indices for array: array is 0-dimensional, but 1 were indexed

When setting pos_label to None, both computation will work and print out the same result.

<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always
frustrated when ... -->

There is currently no built-in way of assessing the volatility or uncertainty associated with metrics generated via `MetricFrame`. This has important implications for the interpretation of any observed values or differences between groups. For example, if a metric changes significantly under small changes (e.g. through resampling), the difference might be explained fully by something like [sampling error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_error). 

For example, here is a plot from the FairLearn documentation: 

[<img src=""https://fairlearn.org/v0.7.0/_images/sphx_glr_plot_quickstart_002.png"" width=""600"" />](https://fairlearn.org/v0.7.0/_images/sphx_glr_plot_quickstart_002.png)

The differences between the two groups in `accuracy` and `selection_rate` appear to be larger than the differences in `precision` and `recall`. However, it could just be that metrics like `selection_rate` are inherently higher variance metrics than `precision`, which might contextualize why the magnitude of the differences is larger.

## Describe the solution you'd like
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->

I'd like to propose a [bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)) based solution built directly into `MetricFrame`. Bootstrap is a conceptually simple procedure that involves building an empirical distribution of a given metric/dataset by repeatedly:

1. Sampling up to the full size of the dataset _with replacement_
2. Re-calculating the metric on this new sample

When repeated hundreds or thousands of times, we can study the empirical distribution and produce useful summaries like [confidence intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)#Deriving_confidence_intervals_from_the_bootstrap_distribution) for the metric.  

There are several reasons why bootstrap might be an appropriate solution here:

- It is widely adopted and studied, making it a statistically defensible choice
- Bootstrap is agnostic to characteristics of the dataset and metric, making it largely assumption-free and widely applicable
- It is straightforward to explain and implement as a higher level layer on top of the core MetricFrame subroutines

However, it does come with a few downsides. Primarily, bootstrap is very computationally intensive. By definition, it is 100x - 1000x+ as intensive as running the core MetricFrame routine, which makes performance a key concern. This might be mitigated by:

- Having the bootstrap procedure be opt-in, and defaulted to ""off"". This has the added benefit of being completely backwards compatible.
- Improving the performance of the current MetricFrame (which seems to be being addressed by PRs like https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/985). 
- Allowing for parallel processing at the bootstrap layer, as bootstrap is an embarassingly parallel operation. This would achieve an approximately linear speedup with the number of available processes on a user machine. 

Like most methods, bootstrap also does not work if the user supplied dataset is not representative of the population. In addition, bootstrap will struggle with very low sample size or incredibly homogenous groups (e.g. if every member of group A had an identical label). These should also be addressed with appropriate warnings. 

Finally, it's important to point out that error bars derived from bootstrap cannot directly be used to make claims about [statistical significance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance), especially amongst multiple groups simultaneously. In other words, simply looking at overlaps between error bars does not constitute a formal hypothesis test. 

## Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant
<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features
you've considered. -->

There are some alternative resampling methods that might provide tighter estimates or be slightly more computationally efficient, like the [jackknife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackknife_resampling), but these are not as well known in the literature. 

There is also a complementary line of work possible in structuring formal hypothesis tests, but it would supplement this contribution (and not be in place of it). 

## Additional context
<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->

I'd like to work on adding support for bootstrap and confidence intervals in FairLearn. I'm opening this issue to solicit community and maintainer feedback on the general idea, proposed approach, and finer details around the implementation. In addition to general comments, some thoughts on the following topics would be appreciated. 


#### Performance / Parallel Processing

As mentioned earlier, one way to mitigate performance concerns would be to introduce parallel processing capabilities into FairLearn specifically for the bootstrap layer. Because `scikit-learn` is already a FairLearn dependency, we could use the `joblib` library to achieve this with relatively little additional code without taking on any additional dependencies. I'd just like to make sure the concept of multiprocessing and an explicit (rather than implicit) joblib dependency is OK first. 

#### API

There'd be a few proposed changes to the MetricFrame API here, both in the input parameters to the constructor and the output data formats. Here's an example of what the new constructor may look like (additional parameters annoted with a # NEW comment): 

```python3
def __init__(self,
             *,
             metrics: Union[Callable, Dict[str, Callable]],
             y_true,
             y_pred,
             sensitive_features,
             control_features: Optional = None,
             sample_params: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]]] = None,
             n_boot: Optional[int] = None,  # NEW
             quantiles: Tuple[float, ...] = (2.5, 97.5), # NEW
             n_jobs: int = -1 # NEW
):
```

`n_boot` is the number of bootstrap iterations to run. This can be defaulted to None, which means skipping the bootstrap process altogether and ignoring the following parameters. In practice, it would be recommended to set this to ~1000.

`quantiles` are the percentiles from the empirical bootstrap distribution to preserve and report back to the user. This is defaulted to (2.5, 97.5) to represent a 95% confidence interval, but can easily be changed to an 80% interval by setting it to (10, 90). With this type of parameter specification, users can also sample more points than just the endpoints of the confidence interval -- for example, if you are interested in every quartile, the API would be flexible enough to allow for e.g `quantiles = (2.5, 25, 50, 75, 97.5)`, or to allow for asymmetric confidence intervals. We could easily drop this though and replace it with a single floating point number representing the width of the CI. 

`n_jobs` is the popular joblib/scikit-learn parameter representing how many cores a user is willing to use on their machine for parallelization. `n_jobs=1` would use a single processor, `n_jobs=-1` uses every available processor, `n_jobs=-2` is all but one processor, etc. More information here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-n_jobs

In terms of output structure, there are two choices that come to mind: modifying the internals of each `.by_group` dataframe to hold something like a tuple instead of a scalar in each cell, or returning a separate frame for each requested quantile. I tend to prefer the latter approach, which may look something like this: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5302119/144090553-e81d345a-bbf8-447d-9927-4f5a9d92888d.png)

because of its readability and ease of working with -- any operation or workflow established on the ""main"" frame would also work for the quantiles. It would be great to hear thoughts on this, and if it seems like a decent idea, how it might be exposed off the main MetricFrame object (for example, maybe `mf.by_group_intervals` or `mf.by_group_quantiles`)? 

Finally, in terms of plotting, the Pandas Dataframe plotting API has support for error bars: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html#plotting-with-error-bars , and it might be straightforward to extend the plotting documentation to accommodate this.

Would appreciate any and all thoughts!

To improve accessibility of Fairlearn, I would like to help translate the documentation to Spanish. I chatted with the Python in Spanish community about how they translate Python documentation, and here are their recommendations

1. Since Fairlearn documentation is in `.rst` format, I can use `sphinx` to extract text and generate `.po` files
2. With the `.po` files I can organize translations by file
3. Whenever I am ready to show documentation, I can use `sphinx-intl `to generate it in the new language, and display it as they original documents are
4. All translations would be worked on here https://github.com/python/python-docs-es 
5. The translated documentation can be hosted separately (like Scikit-learn https://qu4nt.github.io/sklearn-doc-es/index.html)
6.  Then a link can be added to the Fairlearn website

In the current API reference we vary quite a lot between very minimal descriptions (e.g., in [postprocessing](https://fairlearn.org/v0.7.0/api_reference/fairlearn.postprocessing.html#fairlearn.postprocessing.ThresholdOptimizer)) and quite detailed descriptions (e.g., [reductions](https://fairlearn.org/v0.7.0/api_reference/fairlearn.reductions.html) and [`MetricFrame`](https://fairlearn.org/v0.7.0/api_reference/fairlearn.metrics.html#fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame)). It also varies a bit where what type of information can be found, e.g., sometimes the ""Notes"" are quite heavily used (e.g., [preprocessing](https://fairlearn.org/v0.7.0/api_reference/fairlearn.preprocessing.html)) and references to papers can be found in various places in the docstring.

As we are in the process of adding several techniques, I think it makes sense to somewhat standardize what we want our documentation to look like.

- [ ] Decide where we want each type of information to go (and perhaps create a template?).
- [ ] Add section to contributor guide that explains where what information should go.
- [ ] Update existing documentation accordingly.

Fairlearn currently exposes and makes use of the UCI Adult dataset in a few places, e.g. [in this example](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/blob/1247b081b5cbdf9373595b7e4627c142ae30ae44/examples/plot_grid_search_census.py). (Some recent work)[https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04884] I've been apart of has highlighted a few limitations with UCI Adult and introduced a [few new datasets](https://github.com/zykls/folktables) for fair ML intended to serve as a replacement.

I discussed this briefly with @romanlutz, and I'd love to find a way to incorporate these datasets into fairlearn, perhaps as a dedicated example or as a replacement to UCI Adult in the current example. I'm happy to do most or all of the implementation work needed to make something like that happen, but I first wanted to discuss with the maintainers or others involved with the project what the best way of incorporating these datasets would be. 

Looking forward to discussing.

The smaller textual inconsistencies between the headers of the custom landing page and sphinx-generated pages were resolved through #976, but the layout is still off. This is because the landing page is custom html while the remaining pages all use the pydata-sphinx-theme's default header.

Some perhaps useful information:
The top navbar of our theme seems to be configurable as described in https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/sections.html#the-navbar-items
The default templates are at https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/tree/master/pydata_sphinx_theme/_templates

It is not entirely clear to me whether changing the sphinx header or the custom HTML of the landing page to be consistent with the other is the best way forward. Exploring that is part of this issue and already a meaningful contribution.

There is another planned change to adjust the header to be consistent with the latest design, but this requires bigger changes. E.g., in order to change the ""user guide"" label to ""learn"" we'd need to merge the existing user guide with example notebooks in a reasonable way. All of these changes are not part of this issue, which only targets the layout adjustments necessary to get the headers to be consistent.","2021-10-13 19:08:50","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/978"

The existing headers and structure may not be ideal for helping users discover the section they're actually looking for and are somewhat confusing (as #943 shows). As we're working on the user guide anyway we should consider better ways to structure this section.

The original comment by @hildeweerts:
> All information in `MetricFrame` relate to group comparisons, which is why it is under 'Metrics with Grouping'. I can see why the headers might be a bit confusing though, as `MetricFrame.by_group` by itself is not strictly a metric on its own but a table of disaggregated ""ungrouped"" metrics, so some renaming/restructuring of this section is probably not a bad idea. On a related note, I'd also be in favor of retiring the Fairlearn Dashboard as a separate top-level header. This is all a bit out of the scope for this PR, though (we always try to keep PR's as small as possible to avoid blocking small (uncontroversial) changes by other changes that require more discussion). I'd suggest to open a new issue to re-evaluate the structure of the Assessment section of the user guide.

Full paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05906 ""Why Fairness Cannot Be Automated: Bridging the Gap Between EU Non-Discrimination Law and AI"" by Sandra Wachter, Brent Mittelstadt, Chris Russell

The [implementation details from AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/clarify-data-bias-metric-cddl.html) may be helpful.

This issue is merely about implementing the CDD metric as part of `fairlearn.metrics`. It may prove somewhat challenging for the following reasons:

- If I read our code correctly we're basically taking `metrics, y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features` in our `MetricFrame`, and then we split the `y_true, y_pred` based off of `sensitive_features` and pass those splits individually to the metric functions. That's how we calculate the disaggregated metrics. For the aggregated case we don't do the splits. For CDD, I am a bit puzzled as to how that's supposed to work since it's somewhat more complex and needs the number of positive and negative samples for both the sensitive feature group in question as well as overall. If we only pass the split data then we don't have the overall data to calculate CDD. We could use `functools.partial` to define a function where we pass in the positives and negatives for the overall dataset (or rather the model's predictions on the dataset since we'd be ignoring `y_true`) to work around this problem. I suppose a helper function that does this based on `y_pred` would be nice.
- The aggregate of CDD for the whole dataset doesn't make a lot of sense since it would just be 0. That's fine, though.
- The name CDD can cause confusion as we have a metric called demographic parity.

Assuming people agree with this rough outline, this item requires:
- implementation of CDD in `fairlearn.metrics`
- proper API documentation in the numpydoc format, ideally with a small example and attribution to the paper mentioned above. Importantly, we should explain what high (1) and low (-1) values mean and what the ideal value is (0) 
- In the user guide we have a [table](https://fairlearn.org/v0.7.0/user_guide/assessment.html?highlight=partial#scalar-results-from-metricframe) where this could be added. I believe `group_max` would be the most meaningful aggregation (?)

This made me aware that I don't know the best way to refer to various groups of people. Is it ""blacks"", ""Blacks"", ""Black people"", ""black people"", or something completely different? Same applies to other groups.

I vaguely remember somebody telling me that we should use ""Black people"" instead of ""Blacks"" (and the same for other groups of people). I searched for a reference and only found this admittedly somewhat old reference from 2016 https://splinternews.com/why-we-dont-call-people-blacks-and-whites-1793864403

Similarly, for ""female"" I stumbled upon https://jezebel.com/the-problem-with-calling-women-females-1683808274 which mentions similar points. Using ""<adjective>s"" rather than ""<adjective> people"" is dehumanizing. I tend to agree, but I'm certainly no expert and would prefer to defer to people who belong to the respective groups. From my point of view, ""white people"" is definitely preferable to ""whites"". 

""Males"" sounds kind of weird to me for some of the same reasons mentioned in https://medium.com/fearless-she-wrote/woman-vs-female-67fd4c36fe59 about ""female"".

I'd love for people to chime in if they have thoughts, or even just to drop in a link if there's a good article that explains your point of view. Then we can hopefully collect the best ways to refer to the various groups of people and document it in a styleguide in our contributor guide. Ideally, if someone already knows of such a guide we can also just refer to it.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","1003019934","FEAT: Fairness of exposure ## Fairness of exposure
Would like to extend Fairlearn with tools to deal with fairness in rankings (https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues/945). I think that an intuitive and good metric for fairness in rankings is exposure. From the paper: [Fairness of exposure in rankings](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3219819.3220088) by Ashudeep Singh and Thorsten Joachims.

Where exposure is defined as:
<img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Exposure(d_i | P) = \sum_{j=1}^N P_{i,j} v_j"">
,with document d_i, probabilistic ranking P and logarithmic discount v_j to deal with position bias (higher rankings get exponential more attention)
<img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=v_j = \frac{1}{log_2(1 %2B j)}"">

With exposure, all kinds of fairness metrics can be constructed. Such as:

### 1. Allocation harm
Where you equalize the average exposure of documents.
Denoting average exposure in group k with:

<img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Exposure(G_k | P) = \frac{1}{|G_k|} \sum_{d_i \in G_k} Exposure(d_i | P)"">
And denoting the demographic parity constraint with:

<img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Exposure(G_0 | P) = Exposure(G_1 | P)"">


### 2. Quality-of-service harm
<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1357585/134221120-e9fee764-90dd-42c1-aaac-2d16346ce290.JPG"" width=300 align=right>
Where you try to keep the relevance of the items proportional to the exposure. Like in the example on the right, small differences in relevance between candidates can lead to huge differences in exposure. 

<img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{Exposure(G_0 | P)}{U(G_0 | q)} = \frac{Exposure(G_1 | P)}{U(G_1 | q)} "">
,where U(G|q), is the average utility of a group. And utility is the relevance score, on which the documents are ranked. 
<img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U(G_k | q) = \frac{1}{|G_k|} \sum_{d_i \in G_k} u_i "">


### Problem
The problem with this metric is that you need a given probabilistic ranking P, which you can create when you have multiple rankings with the same documents. To work around this, and try to make the metric work for a single ranking, I thought about defining exposure as the sum of logarithmic discounts for ranking tau. Which would define demographic parity as:

<img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Exposure(G_k | \tau) = \frac{1}{|G_k|} \sum_{d_i \in G_k} \frac{1}{log(1 %2B \tau_i)}"">

### Conclusion
Think that with the adjustment, this is an effective way to deal quantify fairness in rankings. Please let me know what you think

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","995998032","FEAT: add fairness-aware Principal Component Analysis (preprocessing) PCA, one of the most common dimensionality reduction techniques might produce data representations that are inherently prone to unfairness. For example, an embedding of the data created by PCA might represent a certain race group much better than another.
 
In recent years a couple of alternatives have been proposed to ensure that disparity between sensitive groups is mitigated.
My inspiration/literature research is based on the following three papers:

[Fair PCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00103), [Efficient Fair PCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04931), [Multi Objective approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06137).

The first paper: Fair PCA aims to minimize the maximum additional reconstruction error for each population above the optimal n to d projection for that population alone. (the optimal projection is obtained by running PCA only on the sensitive group you are considering). See the image below for more details.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38749496/133259524-218023b0-1d2f-4815-ab62-8a6356a77d06.png)
 
The algorithm used to solve this problem relaxes the problem to a semidefinite optimization problem and solves the SDP, next they solve an LP designed to reduce the rank of said problem. This results in a relatively slow algorithm with as output a projection that has optimal fairness using at most d + k -1 features,, where d is the desired number of output features and k is the number of sensitive groups. (this algorithm is later changed to run slightly faster and require fewer additional features for the projection, see [updated algorithm](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331429524_Fair_Dimensionality_Reduction_and_Iterative_Rounding_for_SDPs)).

The second paper [Efficient Fair PCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04931) uses a different loss function, namely that of pairwise disparity error. It is much alike the previous loss function however computes the difference in additional reconstruction error between each group. All of these errors are added as additional minimization objectives and the optimization then becomes to minimize the general reconstruction error as well as all additional objectives. They use an adaptive optimization technique based on gradient descent to solve this. It is guaranteed to converge to a Pareto stationary point and runs much faster than the previous discussed algorithm. Furthermore, it does not require any additional features and seems to work better for mitigating fairness by the experiments in their paper.

Finally, [Multi Objective approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06137) takes a different approach. Instead of creating a different projection matrix they aim to make the ""fairest"" selection of principal components. They measure fairness by taking the difference of reconstruction errors between both sensitive groups. They try to optimize the fairness measure and the total reconstruction error simultaneously by an evolutionary algorithm called [SPEA2](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/SPEA2%3A-Improving-the-strength-pareto-evolutionary-Zitzler-Laumanns/b13724cb54ae4171916f3f969d304b9e9752a57f). 

This method is nice for already deployed algorithms since it does not require to run a different PCA version. It only requires to reorder the principal components. 

I still have my doubts on the fairness measures accompanied by the algorithms and would like some discussion about that.
However, I do believe that implementing both  [Efficient Fair PCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04931), [Multi Objective approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06137) would be useful. Note that both focus on solving a multi objective optimization approach so I would need to check whether one of the two optimization algorithms is faster and whether they can be applied to both problems.

I would take this upon me so if someone can assign me to this, that would be great!

Let me know what you think and feel free to ask any questions!

Tasks:

- [ ] Think of a reasonable fairness measure
- [ ] Check whether optimization methods are applicable to both and check which one is faster
- [ ] implement efficient Fair PCA
- [ ] implement post processing fair PCA

Hi everyone!
I have been researching ways to quantify fairness in rankings and think that this would be a great addition to the Fairlearn package. 

Examples of rankings that have fairness risks are:
- SAT datasets
If a university can only hire k students. They might want to rank students based on their SAT scores. In this dataset, women scored on average 25 points less on this test compared to men.
- German credit dataset
A bank can only give out k loans and want to rank loan applicants by credit score. But the credit score system is known to have a bias against women and younger applicants.
- Compas recidivism prediction
When you want to rank the top-k criminals least likely to recidivate to consider a reduced sentence. There might be discrimination by race, age, or gender.
- Other applications include fields like job hiring or dating apps

As @romanlutz  said on discord: 

> Looks like it's not triggering for new pull requests. I checked their pages and can't really find anything definitive, but it seems like we have 2,500 weekly credits of which we've used 2,342. That sounds like we still have some... That said, this is for the week starting Aug 1, so it definitely looks like our usage is high for this tier. They're trying to sell us a $60/month plan.

We should investigate this issue and figure out how we can proceed. I'll check what we have on the sklearn side.

@amueller do you happen to know anything related to this?

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","956277065","Support minibatch training #### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
It is hard to train with large data/high-dimension language embedding with fairlearn because it requires passing in the whole x matrix, which results in out-of-memory. 

#### Describe the solution you'd like
Support minibatch training. (I understand that for ExponentiatedGradient it requires the same data every run with different weights, but this should be fine if the minibatches are kept consistent every time fit is called.)

#### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant
<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features
you've considered. -->
Currently I need to find low-dimension sentence embeddings, and implement my own ""fit"" function to take minibatches, and ensure it is consistent every time fit is called so that the termination condition of ExponentiatedGradient makes sense.

#### Additional context
<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","956272986","""Phase 1 of the simplex method failed to find a feasible solution"" error in linprog of ExponentiatedGradient #### Describe the bug

I got the error ""ValueError: Phase 1 of the simplex method failed to find a feasible solution. The pseudo-objective function evaluates to 1.2e+02 which exceeds the required tolerance of 1e-09 for a solution to be considered 'close enough' to zero to be a basic solution. Consider increasing the tolerance to be greater than 1.2e+02. If this tolerance is unacceptably large the problem may be infeasible.""

This does depend on data, and is not consistent. If needed, I can provide data.

At first glance it seems like a `FutureWarning`. This has been failing since July 5th (without any change compared to July 4th) which is roughly when pandas released a new version. Technically that was 3 days earlier, but I confirmed that the pipeline was still using the pandas version 1.2.5 until July 4th.

Since this test doesn't do anything special I'm wondering whether it's an xgboost internal issue. @riedgar-ms any thoughts?

Currently, the Fairlearn logo in the docs generated by sphinx points to *""../_static/_static/images/fairlearn_full_color.png""* which doesn't exist. 

~~It seems that '_static' is currently prepended in `html_logo = ""_static/images/fairlearn_full_color.png""` in conf.py even though we also define the `html_static_path = ['_static']`. I expect that this used to be a bug in sphinx and that it is now fixed there, breaking our link.~~

~~In [conf.py](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/blob/main/docs/conf.py) replace line 144:~~

#### Describe the bug

`GridSearch` is being too restrictive when validating its inputs, rejecting data which it should be able to handle

#### Steps/Code to Reproduce

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from fairlearn.reductions import GridSearch
from fairlearn.reductions import DemographicParity, ErrorRate
from fairlearn.metrics import MetricFrame, selection_rate, count

from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
data = fetch_openml(data_id=1590, as_frame=True)
X_raw = data.data
Y = (data.target == '>50K') * 1


A = X_raw[""sex""]
X = X_raw.drop(labels=['sex'], axis=1)

le = LabelEncoder()
Y = le.fit_transform(Y)

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test, A_train, A_test = train_test_split(X,
                                                                     Y,

If the errors are specified as asymmetric confidence bounds, we could simply compute the worst case (e.g. ""largest possible upper bound - smallest possible lower bound"") to give an idea of the range.

However, in the last few weeks it's often (note: not always!) produced the documentation based on the `main` branch rather than the PR branch. This means we can't validate that the new docs will look right. Instead, we have to check out the branch locally and build it which wastes a ton of time.

Ideally we should figure out what's wrong with CircleCI and fix it. Perhaps they've changed something about this behavior recently, perhaps the code checkout logic needs to be adjusted or something like that. This issue requires a bit of investigation from someone who's ideally already somewhat familiar with CircleCI and sphinx doc builds.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","892783389","Support different costs for false positives and false negatives in ExponentiatedGradient #### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

In many binary classification problems, the costs of false positives do not equal to the costs of false negatives, but our `ExponentiatedGradient` only allows classification accuracy as the objective, which assumes that these costs are equal.

#### Describe the solution you'd like

We should extend the moment `ErrorRate` to allow for asymmetric costs, and also allow specifying these costs in the constructor to `ExponentiatedGradient`.

I'm thinking that there are two natural API choices. Say, we're considering fairness under demographic parity and the costs for false positives and false negatives are 1.0 and 0.1. Then:

```python
# Current API, which does not allow specifying asymmetric costs for the objective:
expgrad = ExponentiatedGradient(
    learner,
    constraints=DemographicParity())

# API idea (1): Allow specifying the objective via a moment object
expgrad = ExponentiatedGradient(
    learner,
    constraints=DemographicParity(),
    objective=ErrorRate(costs={'fn': 1.0, 'fp': 0.1}))

# API idea (2): Specify the objective costs more directly
expgrad = ExponentiatedGradient(
    learner,
    constraints=DemographicParity(),
    objective_costs={'fn': 1.0, 'fp': 0.1})
```
I slightly prefer API (1), because it allows for extensions into future in case we want to support other objective functions.

The API (2) is a bit simpler and matches #473, but it could be a bit confusing, because `objective_costs` would not be applicable when we are using `ExponentiatedGradient` for regression.","2021-05-16 23:27:48","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/804"

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","891887124","Stop MetricFrame errors on nonscalar metrics #### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

`MetricFrame` is quite relaxed as to the return values of the metric functions it evaluates. For example, it is perfectly possible to return a confusion matrix or a confidence bound from a metric function.

However such metrics will cause a problem if the user tries calling `group_min()`, `group_max()`, `difference()` or `ratio()` on the resultant `MetricFrame` since those operations are only well defined for scalars.

Currently, we (or rather `pandas`) will throw an exception. This is defensible if only a single metric is being computed by the `MetricFrame` but is likely to lead to a lack of user delight if there are other metrics present for which those operations do make sense. In particular, if a user has constructed a `MetricFrame` consisting of both the `accuracy_score` and `accuracy_score_confidence_interval` then they would reasonably expect `group_min()` to give a useful answer for the `accuracy_score` column.

#### Describe the solution you'd like

Catch any exceptions from `group_min()` and `group_max()` and emplace `NaN` in this case.

#### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant

Without this, users are forced to split up related metrics into separate `MetricFrame` objects.

Because fairness itself is unobservable (and is fundamentally contested), users of Fairlearn need to make decisions about what their theoretical understanding of fairness is, and how they operationalize it via observable properties. At each stage, assumptions are made, which need to be tested.

Measurement modeling provides a language and a framework for making those assumptions explicit and testing them.

As many users of Fairlearn may not have quantitative social science backgrounds, we need to provide explanations and examples of the process of measurement modeling, including key concepts such as construct validity and construct reliability. 

This issue is focused on construct reliability (to keep the issues smaller and more achievable). Issue #769 focuses on construct validity.

See Jacobs and Wallach (2021) for more information.

#### Suggest a potential alternative/fix
Create a glossary explaining key terms from construct reliability, with explanations of what they might mean for measuring fairness.

Race is a multi-dimensional construct and which measurement you choose can impact the conclusions you can draw. I believe that many data sets collected in the US use the census racial categories, which may or may not be good for your purposes (see Hanna et al.). In other countries (e.g., the Netherlands) race is typically not collected at all and the focus is more on ethnicity. Although race and ethnicity are not the same thing, I think it makes sense to discuss both and highlight differences.

Lacking the lived experiences, I personally don't feel very comfortable writing ""best practices"" on collecting and working with data on race. I would be happy to summarize some of the findings of Hanna et al. (2019), but I think it would be much better if we could involve some more experienced experts here.

> [ ] Genderfluid / Gender non-conforming
> [ ] Questioning

In some cases people don't start at data collection, but rather already have a dataset with certain demographic data that may not conform to such best practices. Our best practices should mention that as well, and what one can and should do in such a case. A very common situation is to find a dataset with a `sex` column only. Additionally, I've seen plenty of dataset where we see columns like `sex` or `gender` but it's unclear whether these were self-reported or inferred/guessed by someone (or a system) which obviously makes a huge difference.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","877914650","Counterfactual Analysis Documentation with VW Support **Introduction:** Hey all, I am a participant of Microsoft's RL Open Source Fest this summer and I am very excited to begin contributing to FairLearn by writing out a documentation containing counterfactual analysis using logs synthetically generated by Vowpal Wabbit. I am creating this issue to track my progress and to provide the community an opportunity to respond with additional suggestions that would be great to include in the final product.

**Background:** Researchers from CMU have published a study, provided in their paper [Counterfactual Risk Assessments, Evaluation, and Fairness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.00066.pdf), which details an approach to incorporate counterfactual analysis on both synthetic and domain-specific datasets. They have also built out an [R script](https://github.com/mandycoston/counterfactual) to replicate the results shown in the paper.

**Action Items:** On my behalf, I plan to:
- Use Vowpal Wabbit to generate synthetic datasets (detailed in Microsoft Research's paper, [A Contextual Bandit Bake-off](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04064.pdf)) in preparation for documentation. [Python code](https://github.com/albietz/cb_bakeoff) to generate these datasets is additionally provided.
- Convert the provided R script to Python and replicate the results shown in the Counterfactual Risk Assessments, Evaluation, and Fairness paper.
- Build a local Jupyter notebook detailing the steps outlined in Counterfactual Risk Assessments, Evaluation, and Fairness using these generated datasets and reproduceable and ideally well documented code.
- Attach the final product here for community review and potential next steps.

**Extensions to Further Consider:** Given this, here are some follow-up thoughts to consider:
- The Counterfactual Risk Assessments, Evaluation, and Fairness paper currently only supports binary class labeling and naturally, we'd like to extend our analysis to account for applications under the multi-class setting. Is it natural to approach this similar to [logistic regression's multiclass setting](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) in sklearn?
- Similar to the previous paper mentioned, the documentation should also support a domain-specific open source dataset to study how counterfactual analysis will perform. In the [proposal](https://vowpalwabbit.org/rlos/2021/projects#14-extend-fairlearn-to-include-rl-bias-analysis-using-vw), there is an additional note that recommended looking at ""concepts such as Atkinson Index and Simpsons Paradox to identify sources of inequality"", so being able to identify those open source datasets would additionally be great to have. Does anyone know of any great recommendations here?

I'm always happy to hear any additional suggestions or thoughts to further consider in this documentation. Feel free to post and let me know if there are any! 

Thanks again for the warm welcome!

Measurement modeling is a framework from quantitative social sciences, involving a process of measuring theoretical constructs that cannot be observed directly (such as fairness) by making inferences from observable properties.

Because fairness itself is unobservable (and is fundamentally contested), users of Fairlearn need to make decisions about what their theoretical understanding of fairness is, and how they operationalize it via observable properties. At each stage, assumptions are made, which need to be tested. 

Measurement modeling provides a language and a framework for making those assumptions explicit and testing them.

Speech To Text - Some common metrics used in STT include Word Error Rate (which looks at the difference between the uttered text and the transcribed text). Another example is ""sentence error rate"" where if _any_ mistakes are made in the transcription, the utterance is given a 1, otherwise 0. 

While these metrics are specifically related to the text scenario described above, it would still be very useful to use Fairlearn to see them disaggregated. 

#### Describe the solution you'd like
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->

These Metrics could either be built into the MetricFrame, or the MetricFrame could support custom metrics for a user's scenario (i.e: the user defines the metric of interest)

#### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant
<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features
you've considered. -->

Built a dashboard for these metrics outside of Fairlearn.

#### Additional context
<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->

Scikit-learn has a button for Binder (e.g., in [this example](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/bicluster/plot_spectral_biclustering.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-bicluster-plot-spectral-biclustering-py)) so this should be possible to add since we're using a similar set of sphinx extensions such as sphinx-gallery.

The way scikit-learn achieves this is by adding the following lines to the sphinx gallery configuration: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/309f135c3284d7db6e23ca81a87948c7066a3949/doc/conf.py#L338
... and there's a dedicated `requirements.txt` file.

Other than adding that requirements file and the configuration for sphinx gallery, this would require building the website. Instructions are on [this page](https://fairlearn.org/main/contributor_guide/development_process.html#building-the-website), but I suggest going with the ""simple"" method rather than building the website for all versions. After all, we wouldn't expect the button to show up in past versions.","2021-05-02 00:25:02","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/764"

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","865258414","MetricFrame should support metrics that don't require y_true and y_pred Right now `MetricFrame` only works with metrics with the signature `metric(y_true, y_pred)`, but its disaggregation functionality should be much more broadly applicable. Two use cases of interest:

1. **Dataset-only metrics or prediction-only metrics**. These are the metrics of the form `metric(y_true)` and `metric(y_pred)`. While in principle these could be handled by the current API, it's a bit confusing.
2. **Metrics for settings beyond classification / regression**. For example, to evaluate a contextual bandit algorithm, the metrics have the signature `metric(actions, rewards, propensities)`. This use case comes up in settings with partial observations, e.g., in lending: we only observe whether the person repays a loan (reward) for the specific loan type we provide (action), including ""no loan"".

I think regardless of how the API is tweaked, there's an obvious first step. And then hopefully a not-too-controversial second step.

## Step 1: Make MetricFrame arguments keyword-only

The suggestion is to change the current API, which is this:
```python
MetricFrame(metric, y_true, y_pred, *, sensitive_features, control_features=None, sample_params=None)
```
To something like this:
```python
MetricFrame(*, metrics, y_true=None, y_pred=None, sensitive_features, control_features=None, sample_params=None)
```
So all arguments would be keyword-only and `metric` would become `metrics` (for consistency with other arguments and with `columns` in pandas). The functionality wouldn't change. 

## Step 2: Allow flexible names of shared sample parameters

Change the signature to:
```python
MetricFrame(*, metrics, sensitive_features, control_features=None, sample_params=None, **shared_sample_params)
```
The idea is that any of the `shared_sample_params` are passed on to all metrics, whereas `sample_params` is (as before) a dictionary. With the new signature, it would still be possible to write things like
```python
mf = MetricFrame(metrics=skm.accuracy_score, y_true=y_true, y_pred=y_pred, sensitive_features=sf)
```
But it would be simple to use other kinds of metrics that do not work with `y_true` and `y_pred`.","2021-04-22 17:52:25","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/756"

I'm trying to run some fairness analysis on some of our models, where we can produce either classification or regression models. With regression, I found that it was failing to calculate metrics as it was expecting y_test to have values of only 0 and 1, which isn't true for our regression dataset. Strangley, even if I sent in a dummy y_test which only contained 0s and 1s, it still failed with the same error.

# I tried synthesizing a y_test with only 0 and 1, and it still failed

y_test['ERP'][0] = 1

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

#### Describe the bug
<!--
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
-->

The ThresholdOptimizer returns incorrect group performance results when multiple sensitive features are given. If the multiple sensitive feature columns are concatenated into a single column, the results appear more inline with what we intuitively expect.
This bug was found when optimizing for `balanced_accuracy_score` with the fairness constraint of `equalized_odds`.

<!--
Please add a minimal example (in the form of code) that reproduces the error.
Be as succinct as possible, do not depend on external data. In short, we are

The user guide currently does explain what fairness metrics *mean* in a real-world scenario (i.e., beyond their mathematical definition), do not provide guidance on the scenarios in which they may be relevant, nor state some of the inherent limitations of using these metrics to quantify fairness.

#### Suggest a potential alternative/fix

Add more information to the user guide on the applicability as well as limitations of fairness metrics.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","841788465","Structure API reference: individual pages and overview tables #### Describe the issue linked to the documentation

The current format puts the documentation of all functions/classes of a module on a single page. As the pages are getting quite long and often contain different types of functionality (e.g., ""base"" metrics versus fairness metrics in the `metrics` module), it can be difficult to get a good overview of the available functionality. This also makes it harder than necessary to find the documentation of a particular function/class.

#### Suggest a potential alternative/fix

I'd suggest to list the functions/classes in tables with a short description of each item. We can put the actual documentation on a separate page for each function/class. We can put all tables on a single page, similar to [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html) or on a separate page for each module, similar to [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html). My personal preference would go to the latter.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","841788150","Improve consistency of reference format in documentation #### Describe the issue linked to the documentation

The usage of references in the documentation is inconsistent.
* In `ThresholdOptimizer` a reference is linked as a clickable *name (year)* in the **Notes**.
* Functions and classes in the reductions module (`DemographicParity`, `EqualizedOdds`, `ErrorRateParity`, `Moment`, `TruePositiveRateParity`, etc.) link the reference as a clickable *name (year)* in the **description**.
* In `GridSearch` the reference is linked as a clickable *name (year)* in the **description**.
* In `fetch_boston()` in the dataset module the **References docstring** is used, 
* In `fetch_adult()` and `fetch_bank_marketing()` in the dataset module the reference (including the full url and explicit 'Source:') is in the **description**. 

#### Suggest a potential alternative/fix

I'd suggest to follow the [docstring guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) and put proper references in the *References* (i.e. not just links, as they might break).

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","839505501","Update ""Developer Calls"" in Contributor Guide We currently describe Developer Calls in the Contributor Guide, including a link to the notes. 

**EDIT based on conversation below**:
* Change ""Developer Calls"" to ""Community Calls"" in Contributor Guide (https://fairlearn.org/v0.6.0/contributor_guide/index.html#)
* Add old developer call notes to HackMD (https://hackmd.io/QcJ8WBAbQTq6iOgoi0JT4g)
* Remove old developer call notes from website (https://fairlearn.org/v0.6.0/contributor_guide/developer_call_notes/index.html#developer-call-notes)
* Add link to HackMD to Contributor Guide.

~~* We should update the text to Community Calls.~~
~~* I don't think we are planning to publish notes of the community calls each week - unless somebody has a good idea to somewhat automate this process? In my opinion, stale content is even worse than no content, so if we don't plan on adding new content we should probably remove the older developer call notes from the website.~~

~~I am not sure about the bigger picture for updating the website content. @MiroDudik is there some sort of to-do list somewhere?~~

The current ordering of packages in the API reference seems a bit random to me:

#### Suggest a potential alternative/fix

I can see a few options:
* Order alphabetically
* Order based on functionality, e.g.:
   * fairlearn.metrics
   * fairlearn.preprocessing
   * fairlearn.postprocessing
   * fairlearn.reductions
   * fairlearn.widget
   * fairlearn.dataset

My preference would probably be alphabetically, but either is fine with me.

-->

#### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always
frustrated when ... -->

I want to incorporate generalized entropy and other information-theoretic metrics to FairLearn, both for evaluating the distribution of empirical distribution of outputs of a predictive model and the distribution of labels and protected groups in dataset.

#### Describe the solution you'd like
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->

Create an `Entropy` method with the instantiation of the [Generalized Entropy Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_entropy_index). From there, derived entropy metrics, such as the Atkinson Index, can be defined methods wrapping the `Entropy` function with specific input parameters.


#### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant
<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features
you've considered. -->

Add methods directly to `MetricFrame` class to support calculation of entropy-based metrics.


#### Additional context
<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->
Here are some use cases that use entropy or information-theoretic methods to assess fairness of a technical system:

- [Fairness in Experimentation: Inequality in A/B Testing as an approach to Responsible Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05819)
- [Detecting and Reducing Bias in High-Stakes Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11474)

The metric plotting functionality mentioned in the [docs](https://fairlearn.org/main/user_guide/assessment.html#plotting-grouped-metrics) does not mention `control_features`

#### Describe the solution you'd like

Add an example where `control_features` are used. In the same example we could use `age` as a control feature. However, whenever #793 is completed we should switch to the synthetic dataset. After all, it's not ideal to use a real dataset for an abstract purpose of showing this functionality.

#### Bonus

Ideally, a separator line between the control groups or a new line for each set of subgroups within a control group would be nice. Right now they're all treated as equal groups in the plots.

With #561 one can pass in only a single metric. It would be nice to extend that to pass in multiple metrics rather than just one, and plotting all of them in a series of subplots.

#### Describe the solution you'd like
The existing functionality could be extended to take a single metric or a list of metrics. This wouldn't even require an API change (other than the description, of course).

#### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant
Alternatively, one could also just call the existing function `n` times. Then you get `n` different plots.

With the introduction of `matplotlib`-based plotting functions in #561 we are adding ways to plot metrics for all groups as defined by `sensitive_features`. To get to parity with the `FairlearnDashboard` we should also add model comparison visualizations. This would be pretty much identical to the following existing view:

could we use a `Pipeline` instead of `get_dummies`? See #649

_Originally posted by @adrinjalali in https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/614#discussion_r547870456_

Using a `Pipeline` with all the preprocessing steps is cleaner and a better practice. However, we currently can't pass a `Pipeline` to mitigation techniques since they run `check_X_y` internally. If there are preprocessing steps, they are not executed before this check and we get a failure.

# Goals
- use `Pipeline` in examples, tests, etc. (we have several places with `get_dummies` which are almost identical
- fix mitigation technique behavior to work with `Pipeline`s that include preprocessing steps
- stretch goal (perhaps out of scope for the initial PR): make it possible to pass our mitigation techniques to `Pipeline`s.","2020-12-31 00:16:00","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/665"

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","761803442","Support for streaming metrics #### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

I am using fairlearn to evaluate deep learning models. In this context, we often compute metrics per batch due to the large size of the dataset. In addition, some tasks such as semantic segmentation are so expensive that we can't hold all the predictions in memory.

#### Describe the solution you'd like
I would like if `MetricFrame` would accept an `update` method where we can add more data. For the first version, we can simply add more data to the internal representation of `ytrue, ypred, sensitive_attribute`. But then I would like it if we could keep a confusion matrix and the `update` method would update this confusion matrix.

#### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant

I made a wrapper around Fairlearn metrics that keep tracks of `ytrue, ypred, sensitive_attribute` and then call the underlying metric when needed.

I have spun up an Azure Compute Instance VM as part of Azure Machine Learning. This VM already comes installed  with Fairlearn 0.4.6 . I have developed a notebook in JupyterLab training a model, and now want to use Fairlearn to look for gender-related biases.

Following the instructions from here: <https://fairlearn.github.io/v0.5.0/quickstart.html#evaluating-fairness-related-metrics>, when I do either `from fairlearn.metrics import MetricFrame` or `from fairlearn.widget import FairlearnDashboard` I get:

```

I have updated to version 0.5.0 with `pip install --upgrade fairlearn`, which succeded with not errors, restarted the kernel, but the error remains.

From the comments in the other bug report, it seems that for this to work the advanced instructions have to be followed from <https://fairlearn.github.io/v0.5.0/contributor_guide/development_process.html#advanced-install>. However this page just says: ""Note that the Fairlearn dashboard is built using nodejs and requires additional steps. "", and these steps are not detailed.

I have also seen the link suggesting using Azure Machine Learning for this, but I want to do it on the VM (or, for that matter, my local laptop).

Guidance appreciated.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","725566825","Improving API Reference format I think our current API Reference could benefit from restructuring. Some ideas:

#### Structure API Reference in tables
The current format puts the documentation of all functions/classes of a module on a single page. As the pages are getting quite long and often contain different types of functionality (e.g., ""base"" metrics versus fairness metrics in the `metrics` module), it can be difficult to get a good overview of the available functionality. This also makes it harder than necessary to find the documentation of a particular function/class.

Instead, I'd suggest to list the functions/classes in tables with a short description of each item. We can put the actual documentation on a separate page for each function/class. We can put all tables on a single page, similar to [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html) or on a separate page for each module, similar to [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html). My personal preference would go to the latter.

#### Ordering Attributes/Methods
The attributes and methods of a class are currently ordered alphabetically. 

I'd suggest to group them separately instead, similar to e.g., [this](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html#pandas.DataFrame) or [this](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression)

#### Make References Consistent
The usage of references seems inconsistent. In `fetch_boston()` the *References* docstring is used, in `fetch_adult()` the reference (including the full url and explicit *'Source:'*) is in the description, in `ThresholdOptimizer` a reference is linked as a clickable *name (year)* in the *Notes*, and all functions/classes in the `reductions` module link the reference as a clickable *name (year)* in the description. 

I'd suggest to follow the [docstring guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) and put implementation details/background theory in the *Notes* and proper references in the *References* (i.e. not just links, as they might break).

#### See Also
I always like the *See Also* sections of classes/functions, as they can lead you to different parts of the package you may not have considered yourself, especially if you're new to the field. This is probably something that's not as relevant with the current size of the package, but might be nice to consider as Fairlearn grows.

Also, the widget above that was displaying the y_pred, changes to start and while selecting them, it shows the new output. So no more comparison in the notebook.

The results of `ThresholdOptimizer` are currently not reproducible. Although `random_state` in `ThresholdOptimizer.predict()` helps to ensure reproducibility in the predictions, running `fit()` twice will result in a different optimizer object (and hence different predictions).

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","706856644","Datasets module: keep or remove? As discussed in the [last developer call](https://fairlearn.github.io/contributor_guide/developer_call_notes/2020_09_17.html) I wanted to summarize the discussion around the datasets module so that everyone has a chance to comment including folks who didn't happen to be on that call.

Things to be aware of:
- The module is not part of a released version yet, so removing it would be simple since nobody could be using it yet.
- The reasons for including the module are technical:
  - show how to use a function (create ""minimal examples"")
  - benchmark algorithms, e.g., how well they optimize fairness/performance trade-off under specific quantitative definitions of fairness and performance
  
  but including datasets means we should address sociotechnical aspects. So far we've only scratched the surface of that, e.g. with the ""Notes"" and ""References"" in the [API documentation](https://fairlearn.github.io/api_reference/fairlearn.datasets.html)

- We don't add real functionality, just use functionality from `sklearn.datasets`, namely `fetch_openml`
  - e.g., https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/519
  - potential value prop: we can return sensitive features in addition to X, y
- We have been spending a lot of time discussing this every time a dataset gets added since there are no defined criteria for what gets added and what doesn't, and how much documentation there needs to be.

Options:
1. keep module, define inclusion criteria, and write documentation for each added dataset #507 
2. keep module, but don't spend more time on it until someone is willing to pick up tasks like #507, i.e. don't add more datasets for now
3. remove module, but move educational content into examples (i.e. preserve the documentation on why one needs to be careful with the Boston dataset, for example)


Specifically tagging @koaning and @hildeweerts , but also @MiroDudik @riedgar-ms @adrinjalali @kevinrobinson in case they have more to add. The ""default"" option would be (2) since that doesn't require any changes.

---

Stating my own opinion separately from the overall description: I'm in favor of (3) since it's just as easy to specify the one line of code that `sklearn` provides, and I'd rather see us spend time on other aspects of fairness. However, I'm mostly interested in settling this debate so that we can move on, so if there's consensus on any of these that's fine by me.

I may be wrong, but GridSearch does not allow [sklearn.Pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html) for its estimator.
This would be a useful feature have!

## How to reproduce.
In `test/unit/reductions/grid_search/test_grid_search_arguments.py` add:

```python
# Additional Imports
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Set up Pipeline estimator
class TestPipelineEstimator(ConditionalOpportunityTests):
    def setup_method(self, method):
        self.estimator = Pipeline([('scaler', StandardScaler()), ('logistic', LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear'))])
        self.disparity_criterion = DemographicParity()
```

Then : `pytest test/unit/reductions/grid_search/test_grid_search_arguments.py` would fail with:

```
ValueError: Pipeline.fit does not accept the sample_weight parameter. You can pass parameters to specific steps of your pipeline using the stepname__parameter format, e.g. `Pipeline.fit(X, y, logisticregression__sample_weight=sample_weight)`.
```


### Proposed solution

In GridSearch constructor, we could allow specifying the key for `sample_weight`.

Ex. `GridSearch(self.estimator, self.disparity_criterion, grid_size=2, sample_weight_key='logistic__sample_weight')`

I already made the test so I can add the solution too if it is approved.

#### Describe the bug

When I call  _create_group_metric_set as indicated online at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-machine-learning-fairness-aml , I get the error 
```
Array y_pred is not the same size as y_true
```
, which is clearly not true because I'm passing same-size arrays for y_true and predictions (or even the same variable!).

Please note that the error says ""Array **y_pred** is not the same size as y_true"", rather than ""Array **predictions** is not the same size as y_true"", since the parameter name is **predictions**, not y_pred (as I think it should be in alignment to other functions).

However, if I print **len(y_true)** and **len(y_pred)** at row 133 of **_metrics_engine.py** (in group_summary function), it tells me that y_pred length is 1, rather than the real size I passed, which is the same as y_true.

That function is called by the instruction at row 169 of **_group_metric_set.py**:
>>> gmr = metric_func(result[_Y_TRUE], prediction, sensitive_features=g[_BIN_VECTOR])

where ""prediction"" is a single element of the predictions array. As a result, y_pred array becomes 1 element long, causing the ""not same size"" error reported above.

mitigator.fit(X, y, sensitive_features=sensitive_features)
```

In the model comparison view we can select a sensitive feature and change that selection using a dropdown:

However, when switching to the individual model view by clicking on a model point in the chart the selection does not carry over. The same applies when changing the selection and switching back to the comparison view.

The selection should carry over.

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from fairlearn.datasets import fetch_adult

data = fetch_adult(as_frame=True)
X = pd.get_dummies(data.data)
y = (data.target == '>50K') * 1
sensitive_features = data.data['sex']
mitigator = ExponentiatedGradient(LinearRegression(), DemographicParity())
mitigator.fit(X, y, sensitive_features=sensitive_features)
```
If the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link
it in the issue: https://gist.github.com

Goal: right now we direct people to install requirements.txt in many places. That brings a lot of extra packages into an env that one may not particularly care about. Additionally, we want to have tests to validate that Fairlearn works with other ML packages like tensorflow, pytorch, xgboost, etc., so adding all of these to requirements.txt is infeasible. Related to #231 as a prerequisite.

The alternative would be to just do custom installations in the pipeline definition, but then it's harder to point people at a file for an installation on their local machine.","2020-07-12 21:55:06","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/516"

When running `GridSearch` or `ExponentiatedGradient` it may take a while to run all the iterations. It would be nice to have an idea about the progress. 

#### Describe the solution you'd like
For `GridSearch` this could be something simple like `completed 7/100 iterations`, or perhaps something more sophisticated like `completed 7/100 iterations, projected to finish in 4:32`. For `ExponentiatedGradient` we can't know the number of iterations ahead of time, but we can tell the user how close we are to the stopping criterion as well as the current iteration number (in case we hit the maximum number of iterations).
We should perhaps also think about solutions other packages have for this.

On this issue, I'd like to brainstorm the right structure for project boards / labels. I think that together with @romanlutz , we will play a bit with the project boards and keep this issue open until we reach a bit of stability.

Some ideas:

If there is an obvious set of items / tasks that comes up within an issue or a proposal, then it's probably not too much overhead to create more granular issues and tag them as ""high-priority"" (if that's the case) and/or ""help wanted""--and put them in the same project as the proposal. We probably shouldn't mark ""TODOs"" in the proposal and instead just rely on issues (that was my mistake...). If there ends up being a single issue attached to implementation of a proposal, I think that Kevin's suggestion might be easily done by presenting the most up-to-date TODO list at the bottom of the issue--this could be the same comment that's re-edited, or simply the latest comment.

That said--I don't want to force the author of an issue / proposal to split it into smaller tasks if that presents an overhead. I'd rather postpone splitting until there's somebody who wants to help and let them figure it out with whoever submitted the issue (or maybe somebody like the ""project owner"" if we end up having those).

I feel similar about having a ""high-level"" issue tagged as ""epic"" in a project--I'm not opposed, but also don't want to force it, for fear of creating additional overhead.

My current preference is to experiment with project boards and labels. This will help us manage the workflow and ever-so-slightly help with the ""discoverability"" of the more granular tasks in support of the already planned work.

The project boards should complement the ""Short-term roadmap"". I like the approach suggested by @kevinrobinson in [#500](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/500#discussion_r443040820) -- if we use the (short-term?) roadmap to describe the real-world problems we're trying to address (both short-term and long-term), the contributors will be able to come up with issues and/or projects themselves and we will have an easier time identifying the ""high-priority"" issues. I'm not yet sure if we should use these ""problems"" as ""projects"" in our project boards... I think we'll need to experiment a bit.

#### Describe the bug
<!--
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
-->
Fairlearn widget will crash when loaded into VS code in some circumstances. 

#### Steps/Code to Reproduce
<!--
Please add a minimal example (in the form of code) that reproduces the error.
Be as succinct as possible, do not depend on external data. In short, we are
going to copy-paste your code and we expect to get the same result as you. 
-->

1. Install VS code
2. Install the ms-python.python extension (it's used for opening notebooks)

Using the notebook in this zip file, opening the notebook and running it will cause a crash in the fairlearn javascript:
[sql_query2.zip](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/files/4806678/sql_query2.zip)

See this bug on the ms-python.python extension for VS code for more information:
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/12394

It should also be noted that VS code tries to load the fairlearn widget js from http://unpkg.com or http://jsdelivr.net. We're unable to find this js so we load the fairlearn js from the jupyter nbextensions folder. This might be what's causing the problem. JS loaded from the nbextensions folder can sometimes have implicit dependencies upon jupyter JS, whereas JS packaged on the CDN is explicit about those.

#### Screenshots
Here's a screenshot of the console log:

So I'll just share a screenshot here to illustrate the rough direction of what I'm talking about, and if this is something folks want to discuss more in a month or two when the various WIP bits of documentation have landed, and we have put together an example notebook or two, I'd be interested in chatting more and seeing if there are ways to merge some of these ideas into fairlearn!

This prototype aspires towards similar goals as articulated in the [microrubric](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/490) for critiquing notebooks, but isn't centered on Fairlearn.  @romanlutz the theory of change here is similar to what we talked about the other day, where the idea is to take ideas at the heart of communities like FAccT, and do the translational work to reach a broader audience of developers.  As [Barocas and Boyd (2017)](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2017/11/222176-engaging-the-ethics-of-data-science-in-practice/fulltext) say:

> All too often, the data scientists we have encountered are quite sympathetic to the sentiment behind the critiques they hear, but feel maligned and misunderstood, unacknowledged for their efforts, and frustrated by vague recommendations that are not actionable... The gaps between data scientists and critics are wide, but critique divorced from practice only increases them. Data scientists, as the ones closest to the work, are often the best positioned to address ethical concerns, but they often need help from those who are willing to take time to understand what they are doing and the challenges of their practice.

I know there's a lot of threads going on right now but I'll be excited to chat more down the line whenever the timing seems right.  I'm just sharing this as a way to try to demonstrate support and show that this line of work could be possible.  👍

I've read through the paper but there are also 90 pages of [supplemental materials](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2019/11/20/366.6468.999.DC1/aag3311_Thomas_SM.pdf) so I do not fully understand everything in there yet :)

This is building on previous discussions like https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues/444, https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues/439, and https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues/460, with the hope that we can roll the discussion in these issues forward into user guides. 😄 


Here's the most relevant comparison sections from the paper:

> Unlike our approach, fairness-aware classification algorithms designed using the standard ML approach do not provide probabilistic guarantees that the resulting classifier is acceptably fair when applied to unseen data. We observed that two state-of-the-art fairness-aware algorithms that we ran for comparison, Fairlearn (24) and Fairness Constraints (25), each produced unfair behavior under at least one definition of fairness.

and in the supplemental bits:

> As described previously,Fairlearn(FL) can enforce definitions of fairness that can be written as a set of linear constraints on conditional moments, such as confusion rates [24].  It includes a tolerance parameter that determines the maximum amount by which fairness can be violated, analogous to in our formulation.  We used the implementation provided by Agarwalet al.[24], which includes code to enforce demographic parity and equalized odds.  For other definitions of fairness,  we set Fairlearn to enforce equalized odds as a surrogate fairness definition, and tested several settings of the tolerance parameter to assess the performance of the approach.  When applying FL to definitions besides demographic parity and equalized odds, we evaluate FL using tolerance values of 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0.

There are some very abstracted charts of different algorithms on different constraints for a single dataset:

The paper doesn't reference real deployment contexts, so there's no way to really critique or evaluate these approaches from a sociotechnical perspective or whether they do anything to mitigate real harms.  And there are some interesting takes on how their method contributes to shifting responsibility (and power) from users to designers.  But if we ignore that :) it might be helpful to understand how the approaches compare in the context of a narrow technical benchmark.

There's an existing [Binary Classification on COMPAS dataset](https://fairlearn.github.io/auto_examples/notebooks/plot_binary_classification_COMPAS.html) example, and discussion in https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues/466#issuecomment-640854619 about potentially using the COMPAS dataset as part of an example or evaluation as well.

Given that the outcome variable is observed with bias with respect to the protected variable, we believe that the second set of approaches designed with the objective of achieving equivalent predictive accuracy by race are inappropriate for this particular application, as they ultimately rely upon comparing the  model’s  predictions  of  re-offense  to  a  fundamentally  flawed  and  biased  measure  of  re-offense:re-arrest.

It depends on the distribution of outcomes affected by the algorithm rather than treatment, and it does so for the full population rather than only for individuals who are part of the algorithm. 

and

> ""A perspective focused on the distribution of power propels us to consider the design of the algorithms themselves: Don’t just ask how the algorithm treats different people differently, but also who gets todo the treating. Specifically, we ask what implicit distribution of social power justifies the current choice of objectives. Such a question foregrounds how power gets allocated, and what is the process that leads some groups to have more control over data in decision making processes.""

In study 1, we ask them to predict whether defendants will recidivate before tried, and manipulate whether they have access to machine advice.

The final layer engages conceptual problems with risk models: Is it fair to make criminal justice decisions about individuals based on groups? We show that each layer depends on the layers below it: Without assurances about the foundational layers, the fairness of the top layers is irrelevant.

I suggest that the constructor `ThresholdOptimizer()` include the possibility of considering asymmetric cost in False Positives and False Negatives. 

As by actual implementation, thresholds are chosen such that given the constraints, the results minimize `P(Yhat = 1, Y = 0) + P(Yhat = 0, Y = 1)`, that is the total fraction of false positives and false negatives (which is equivalent to maximize accuracy).
I simply suggest to add `Cfp * P(Yhat = 1, Y = 0) + Cfn * P(Yhat = 0, Y = 1)`, with default `Cfp=Cfn=1`; or even a single parameter (corresponding e.g. to Cfp/Cfn.

The most general case would be to compute the error as:
`Ctp * P(Yhat = 1, Y = 1) + Ctn * P(Yhat = 0, Y = 0) + Cfp * P(Yhat = 1, Y = 0) + Cfn * P(Yhat = 0, Y = 1)` but it is pretty reasonable to assume that both true positives and true negatives have no cost at all.

By the way, this is also coherent with Hardt et al. (2016) which is the main reference for `ThresholdOptimizer()`.

This issue may be related to PR https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/381, but I cannot see references to cost modification in the code of this PR. 

The changes should be minimal, just add these two parameters in the class `__init__` and then use them in the definition of the error

Any suggestions for how to rename the pipeline? This is complex because in general it should be green/passing.

So we definitely do want to be alerted when it goes red for the first time. That's what makes this tricky.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","631104129","Documentation: Understanding generalization hello!  in building on https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues/444, I was curious what would happen if I took the quickstart example, split the data, and looked at how well the constraints held up on the test set.

Here's what I see in the training dataset using `ExponentiatedGradient` to satisfy the `DemographicParity` constraint on a `DecisionTreeClassifier`.  This is with a 70/30 train/test split, and shows the differences in these metrics between the predictions of the original model, and the predictions of the mitigated model:


```
TRAINING
   accuracy: 0.980 to 0.931
  selection: 0.230 to 0.275
   for male: 0.289 to 0.282
 for female: 0.110 to 0.261

TEST
   accuracy: 0.813 to 0.759
  selection: 0.233 to 0.292
   for male: 0.288 to 0.319
 for female: 0.119 to 0.236
```

This is just a single run with one seed, but the demographic parity difference for selection rate changes quite a lot - from `0.021` (28.2% vs. 26.1%) to `0.083` (31.9% vs. 23.6%).

Of course in the real world there's distribution drift and many other things to consider, but I'm trying to understand even if the training and test data were drawn from the same underlying distribution with no noise, is the mitigation approach just overfitting?  Code for the modeling is below.

```
X, y_true = adult()
trial_one = attempt(X, y_true, seed=11)

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","630856703","Roadmap for interpretability of fairness metrics? The correct interpretation of almost any fairness metric relies on which label is positive and which sensitive groups are compared. At the moment, for most metrics, these considerations are implicit in the API. For example, all confusion_matrix related performance metrics will return labels as: “those that appear at least once in y_true or y_pred are used in sorted order” due to the dependency on scikit-learn, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the fairlearn documentation. 

I was wondering whether there are plans to help users (particularly those who do not use the dashboard) interpret the metrics correctly.

I do not have a strong opinion on what it should look like, but I can imagine e.g. consistent usage of ``pos_label`` and an equivalent argument for privileged group membership might help (although the latter is tricky for polytomous sensitive features). Or perhaps some accompanying textual information, e.g. if demographic_parity_difference = 0.10, one could retrieve an 'explanation' along the lines of ""selection rate of group=1 (largest) is 0.10 higher than the selection rate of group=2 (smallest)"".","2020-06-04 14:06:07","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/458"

I think the organization of files in the fairlearn.metrics module could be improved,

Additionally,~~ 

navigating the repository was not very intuitive for me. For example, some of the performance metrics not directly available in scikit-learn have their own file (e.g. _balanced_root_mean_squared_error.py), whereas others are grouped in (e.g. _extra_metrics.py).

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","627792515","Documentation: Understanding ExponentiatedGradient's termination and guarantees I'm trying to better understand what leads `ExponentiatedGradient` to terminate.  In particular, I'm trying to understand this in terms that I could translate to a non-technical person who wants to understand if they can control how much slack there is around the selection rates being exactly equal.  To make this concrete, I'm looking at the example in the quickstart guide, where a `DemographicParity` constraint for the `sex` column is applied to a task predicting which people earned over $50k.  I'd like to understand how to apply the `ExponentiatedGradient` so that it will enforce that the value of `demographic_parity_difference` is < 0.05 across the male and female groups.

I looked into understanding how the `eps` and `nu` params influence this.  I also noticed the `_MIN_ITER` check, and that the example scenario would terminate earlier if this is disabled.

To experiment, I set `eps=0.05` but found that this produced a demographic parity difference of `0.072`, so outside of the bounds I was expecting.  Similarly, setting `eps=0.10` produced a demographic disparity of `0.149` which was out of the bounds of what I was expecting.  So I'm figuring I'm misunderstanding something important here.

If it's helpful, this is the code from the quickstart I'm starting from, and an example of what that case shows with debug logging enabled.  The examples above all use the same `seed(0)` from the quickstart.

```

classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier()
mitigator = ExponentiatedGradient(classifier, constraint, eps=whatever)

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","626838581","Documentation: In what situations would this approach be preferable to TFCO? hello!  I was reading the TFCO paper ([Cotter et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.04198.pdf)), and it has a great section on past work, including this section:
> Agarwal et al. (2018) recently addressed training classifiers with fairness constraints. Like this work, their proposed algorithm is based on the two-player game perspective. Unlike this paper, they assume a zero-sum game, which works because they also assume oracle solvers for the two players, side-stepping the practical issues of dealing with the non-differentible non-convex indicators in the constraints, which is the focus of our algorithmic and theoretical contributions. Similar to this work, they output a stochastic classifier, but do not provide the sparse m+1 solution that we present in this work. They also consider a deterministic solution, which they produce by searching over a grid of values for λ for the best λ. They noted in their experimental section that the resulting deterministic solution was generally as good as their stochastic solutions on test data for those experiments they tried it on. As they note, a grid-search over λ is less ideal as the number of constraints grows.

To check my understanding, the essential differences is that fairlearn asks you to pick the `n` for the grid search over the values of λ, and then the intent of the dashboard visualizations is to pick a model from that grid search based on the (disparity, accuracy) tradeoff.  In constrast, TFCO allows generating a stochastic classifier that essentially picks from different points in that search, but also allows ""shrinking"" to a smaller model.  And it supports a wider range of ""rate constraints"" than the metrics described in `fairlearn`.

I'm sure there's also a range of factors related to the ecosystem and developer experience (eg, TF vs. emphasis on sci-kit compatability), so would be curious to hear folks' thoughts on that as well.  If folks want to comment here, I could afterwards repackage thoughts into a PR for https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/436.

There is a rich sociotechnical context surrounding decisions about which applicants are accepted to law school.  In the US, this has been contested for many years, and constitutional challenges to law school admissions policies in particular shaped the legal environment related to admissions for all higher education in the US.  See [Hopwood v. Texas](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/78/932/504514/) which speaks directly to this issue, and subsequent landmark cases like [Grutter v. Bollinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grutter_v._Bollinger) and [Fisher v. University of Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_v._University_of_Texas_(2013)).  The legal context within the US has changed in critically important ways between those time periods.

This papers uses data from a 1998 paper.  That paper describes its motivation as:

> [the LSAC study] was undertaken primarily in response to rumors and anecdotal reports suggesting bar passage rates were so low among examinees of color that potential applicants were questioning the wisdom of investing the time and resources necessary to obtain a legal education

It also notes in the abstract that the study explicitly makes an normative argument about what admissions policies should be, in relation to broader questions of fairness.

In the example notebook, none of this context is currently mentioned.  In fact, the notebook seems to acknowledge that is is modeling doing something that it understands the authors of the original paper would object to:

> This notebook is intended as an example of Fairlearn functionality and not a fully realistic case study of an admission scenario. In real world, one should think carefully about whether it is appropriate to rank or score individuals. Also, additional features beyond the two considered here (GPA and LSAT scores) should be considered in practice, as recommended by the authors of the LSAC study. Finally, in real-world settings, it would be inappropriate to restrict attention to only two of the subgroups without evaluating the impacts on other individuals.

And:

> The authors of the LSAC study conclude that this justifies admission practices that look beyond LSAT and UGPA. However, in this simplified example, we build predictors of bar passage from these two variables alone.

In other words, this example uses the dataset from a 1998 study to model how to use `fairlearn`, in ways that the authors of that study would not endorse.  This isn't a minor issue - the main point of the study is to argue that law school admissions officer should not use the kinds of approaches modeled in this `fairlearn` notebook.  It may also be important to note that the LSAC study starts with a ""Historical introduction"" to situate its work within the broader sociotechnical context.

While the notebook cites the 1998 study, I'm assuming that the deployment context implied here is actually 2020 US.  I'm also assuming the notebook is implying that questions about generalization are not important to fairness work, and perhaps this is not intentional.

🟠 Minimal suggestion: Link to relevant Supreme Court cases.  Add an excerpt the ""Historical Introduction"" from the LSAC study where this data comes from.  Add a deployment context for the notebook scenario (eg, who is using this model, and what are they using it do, where and when is it being deployed).

But I'm also trying to understand if there are ways to demonstrate using `fairlearn` in a law school admissions scenario that would consider the extraordinarily contested sociotechnical context around college admissions.  Are there folks working within higher education admissions using the project that could collaborate on such work?  If not, perhaps other example notebooks drawn from real use cases might better demonstrate how fairlearn fits within the work of teams that view fairness as a sociotechnical challenge.

> In recent years, the credit card issuers in Taiwan faced the cash and credit card debt crisis and the delinquency is expected to peak in the third quarter of 2006 (Chou,2006). In order to increase market share, card-issuing banks in Taiwan over-issued cash and credit cards to unqualified applicants. At the same time, most cardholders, irrespective of their repayment ability, overused credit card for consumption and accumulated heavy credit and cash–card debts. The crisis caused the blow to consumer finance confidence and it is a big challenge for both banks and card holders.

And about where the data came from*:

> Our study took payment data in October, 2005, from an important bank (a cash and credit card issuer) in Taiwan and the targets were credit card holders of the bank.  Among the total 25,000 observations, 5529 observations(22.12%) are the cardholders with default payment. 

And that this work is done from the perspective of lenders aiming to reduce their risk:

> From the perspective of risk control, estimating the probability of default will be more meaningful than classfying customers into the binary results – risky and non-risky.

🟠 Minimal suggestion: Quote the original paper for context.  Add a deployment context for the notebook scenario (eg, who is using this model, and what are they using it do, where and when is it being deployed).

(* Note also that the original paper says the dataset contains 25,000 total records, but the UCI CSV actually contains 30,000 records.  I don't know what where this discrepancy comes from but it's off by 20% so not a small or insignificant data quality question.  This is probably worth understanding separately.)

### Deployment context
It's not clear to me why the training dataset would be used, as most of this data wouldn't be available in what I assume the deployment context is.  The paper acknowledges that this is an open question:

> Therefore, whether or not the estimated probability of default produced from data mining methods can represent the ‘‘real” probability of default is an important problem. 

It then cites 8 papers suggesting this is still an open problem (I didn't look at any of them).  And as best as I can tell, the original paper is not addressing questions about whether data from these current credit card holders, within the context of a national credit card debt crisis, will be relevant for a deployment context that would make decisions about credit risk for new people without past credit history.

More importantly, any lender using such an algorithm would have to make predictions without access to most of the columns in the dataset (eg, credit limit, past payment history, etc).  Perhaps the scenario assumes there are credit reporting agencies, and that they would be receiving that kind of information from other lenders the person applying for the card has previously worked with?  My assumption for now is that this is what the current notebook is assuming.  If so, one relevant data point from the US suggests it might be worth understanding how accurate these data sources tend to be (assuming they work in similar ways in Taiwan), since a [2015 FTC report](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/section-319-fair-and-accurate-credit-transactions-act-2003-fifth-interim-federal-trade-commission/130211factareport.pdf) found that ""26% of the 1,001 participants in the study identified at least one potentially material error on at least one of their three credit reports.""

🟠 Minimal suggestion: Add a deployment context for the notebook scenario (eg, this is a credit card company, they are using it to review applications, this is where and when it is being deployed).


### US law, Equal Credit Opportunity Act
Since many folks on the project team are in the US, here's some related sociotechnical context.  This is definitely US-centric, and banking and credit work very differently in different parts of the world :) but these are illustrative of the kinds of things I'd hope to see in work that viewed fairness as a sociotechnical challenge.

Here's some starting points.  First, the FTC: [Your Equal Credit Opportunity Rights](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0347-your-equal-credit-opportunity-rights/)
<div>
  <img width=""45%"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1056957/81698772-7330a700-9434-11ea-967a-bd770573939c.png"">
  <img width=""45%"" alt=""Screen Shot 2020-05-12 at 9 38 21 AM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1056957/81698727-6613b800-9434-11ea-8cce-9dbbf9a734ec.png"">
</div>

It seems that many of these attributes are included in the model within the current example notebook.  I'm just a layperson, so maybe I'm misunderstanding that guidance.

Here's a few other reference points from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: [Can a card issuer consider my age when deciding whether to issue a credit card to me?](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/can-a-card-issuer-consider-my-age-when-deciding-whether-to-issue-a-credit-card-to-me-en-20/), [My credit application was denied because of my credit report. What can I do?](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/my-credit-application-was-denied-because-of-my-credit-report-what-can-i-do-en-1253/) and [Can a card issuer consider my sex or marital status when deciding whether to issue a credit card to me?](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/can-a-card-issuer-consider-my-sex-or-marital-status-when-deciding-whether-to-issue-a-credit-card-to-me-en-22/):
  <img width=""60%"" alt=""Screen Shot 2020-05-12 at 8 49 04 AM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1056957/81693134-78d6be80-942d-11ea-8eb6-ef788838305c.png"">

> Typically, card issuers may not even ask your sex on an application form, and the form has to disclose that you do not have to indicate Mr., Miss, Mrs., or Ms. on the application. There are also restrictions on asking for information about your marital status. A creditor may not ask about your marital status if you are applying for individual, unsecured credit unless

> If a lender rejects your application based on your credit report, the lender is also required to: Provide you the numerical credit score it used in taking the adverse action and the key factors that affected your score

My interpretation as a layperson is that the notebook is demonstrating practices that would introduce legal and regulatory risk for organizations operating within the US.  That being said,  what is currently legal in different places is certainly only one part of understanding the wider sociotechnical context, especially when what is legal is contested :)

🟠 Minimal suggestion: Add a note that indicates using fields like marriage, age and sex may be illegal within the United States, and link to CFPB guidance.


### Legal and political context
The notebook uses the term ""discrimination"" but it may be worth talking about key aspects of how the term itself is contested politically and legally.  For example, my assumption is that discrimination in this sense is closer to the legal concept of ""disparate impact"" rather than ""disparate treatment.""

This [guidance](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_supervision-and-examination-manual_ecoa-baseline-exam-procedures_2019-04.pdf) from the [CFPB compliance guides](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/guidance/other-applicable-requirements/equal-credit-opportunity-act/) may be a helpful short summary:

<img width=""820"" alt=""Screen Shot 2020-05-12 at 10 16 14 AM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1056957/81702788-be00ed80-9439-11ea-9b35-ce73b12bbb8c.png"">


These concepts are contested, and there's a case history in the US Supreme Court about this (eg, [Texas...](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1371_8m58.pdf)), and HUD has recently [proposed rule changes](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_19_122) related to its interpretation of disparate impact in the context of mortgage lending.  There are legal challenges related to Section 1071 in the Dodd-Frank Act that are specifically about monitoring, reporting and enforcement related to gender, race and ethnicity (recent [CFPB symposium](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/events/archive-past-events/cfpb-symposium-section-1071-dodd-frank-act/), [legal challenge](https://www.consumerfinancemonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2020/03/CA_Reinvestment_Coalition_v._Kraninger_-_order_granting_stip_of_settlement-1.pdf)).

Within algorithmic models in particular, it seems the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau issued a [report to Congress](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/protecting-consumers-and-encouraging-innovation-2019-fair-lending-report-congress/) a few weeks ago that included some commentary on ""the use of alternative data, such as cash flow data, in credit underwriting.""  Additionally there was a ""Request for Information regarding “Tech Sprints” to encourage regulatory innovation and collaborate with stakeholders in developing viable solutions to regulatory compliance challenges.""  So depending on when the context of this notebook is taking place, that may be relevant for folks looking to this project for examples of how to do fairness work within financial services organizations.  Mortgage lending seems much more contested than credit cards, but as another data points here's a [letter from some senators](https://www.consumerfinancemonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2019/06/2019.6.1020Letter20to20Regulators20on20Fintech20FINAL1.pdf):

<img width=""783"" alt=""Screen Shot 2020-05-12 at 10 13 38 AM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1056957/81702513-61053780-9439-11ea-80b1-e8b2f868131d.png"">

So there's a lot of data suggesting that fairness and specifically algorithmic approaches to fairness are likely to be contested in different ways depending on the legal and political context.

🟠 Minimal suggestion: Add a paragraph about discrimination, disparate treatment, and disparate impact within the US legal tradition, drawing from the CFPB guidance.

### Wider economic context
When talking about fairness in these kinds of sociotechnical contexts, particularly related to gender or racial categories, other background context might be important.  Here's some data from the Fed: [Recent Trends in Wealth-Holding by Race and Ethnicity: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances, 2017](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/recent-trends-in-wealth-holding-by-race-and-ethnicity-evidence-from-the-survey-of-consumer-finances-20170927.htm):

<div>
  <img width=""45%"" alt=""Screen Shot 2020-05-12 at 9 56 06 AM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1056957/81700734-12ef3480-9437-11ea-9fce-a8072ba67570.png"">
  <img width=""45%"" alt=""Screen Shot 2020-05-12 at 9 56 37 AM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1056957/81700737-14206180-9437-11ea-99d2-a9e9f2002e73.png"">
</div>

These may be important for understanding how the isolated decision of ""approve or reject credit card application"" fits within other aspects of peoples' experiences within the financial system or credit markets.  There is a lot of context there, but maybe adding one data point would be a start.

Separately, in the US [the NY Fed](https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce/credit-access.html#/) reports information about credit cards it seems, including things like:

> [In February 2020] the rejection rate for credit card applications dropped to 9.7 percent, a new series low.

That seems a useful baseline rate to understand in trying to interpret data on credit card lending decisions.  If the deployment context of the notebook is 2006 Taiwan, that context may be very different (as implied in the original paper's intro).

🟠 Minimal suggestion: Add one data point illustrating the wider sociotechnical context of credit decisions (eg, sociotechnical leading to wealth differences at a given point in time).  Add baseline rate of credit approval or denial for the deployment context.


### De-abstracting
In the US, consumer complaints related to denied credit card applications refused are published by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau [here](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/).  Here's an overview of complaints with getting a credit card across US states over the last three years:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1056957/81698284-bd655880-9433-11ea-93fe-41590d639d40.png)

These are searchable and filterable and some even include narratives from real people, like [this one](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/detail/3562815):

> Reference # XXXX I contacted <company> credit card to discuss the reasoning for their decision. After being transferred to 3 different people I ended up talking to a supervisor named XXXX. My first question was about the credit score. She could not tell me what score that they were using. Examples FICO XXXX, Vantage 3.0, etc. The reason I was asking is because the number reflected was not even close to the actual numbers that I obtained from the credit bureau myself. In addition as we looked over my credit report there was conflicting information through out the report and she could not answer my specific questions. How can a company be following the FCRA if they cant even explain their own information to the consumer?

I understand that an example notebook might want to center the perspective of lenders, as those are the clients that users of this library might be working with.  In that circumstance, these are perhaps examples of the kind of brand or reputational damage that is part of the consideration of fairness work.  Of course the scenario could also choose to include more diverse stakeholders as well (eg, people applying for credit cards).

🟠 Minimal suggestion: Add one paragraph highlighting the experience of being approved or denied a credit card application.

Thanks for reading! 😄  There are many other ways that a project might model approaching working on a ML system that influenced credit decisions, and wider scope that could be tackled here in exploring how libraries and tools could support data scientists and practioners who view fairness as a sociotechnical challenge (particularly in supporting communication and collaboration with non-technical stakeholders). I'd be excited if there were ways to work on that as well, but have shared this in the spirit of opening those wider questions while also providing smaller specific suggestions for improvement.

I think that de-abstracting would really help make productive progress on what excellence in a sociotechnical approach to ML would be.  I think looking at the same scenario and talking about it can help the project to confront the core tension in the work: between the mission on one hand, and the realities of who practioners are, what they believe, and what they need on the other hand.  For me, that's the super unique and compelling opportunity here. :)

There are many media to make educational materials, but I think a narrative Python notebook is the best way to confront this tension, because it's closer to where practitioners live (which is not to suggest that notebooks or software are all that matter!).  There are of course many aspects of a sociotechnical approach to fairness that won't fit nicely in there, and attempts at resolving that tension can be super generative!   I also found @hannawallach's comparison to accessibility super compelling.  That work requires both the mission and vision component, but also the tooling that encodes values related to that vision (eg, linter rules that fail the build if you leave out accessibility attributes in your HTML).

There may be early adopter partners who are aligned with the mission aspect of the project, and that may be a source of potential case study topics to make a notebook about.  But there also may be sources that come from the existing culture of data scientists that are not aligned with the mission.  One that I started hacking around on is the Boston housing dataset, since I happened to come upon it earlier in the week and was a bit blown away by how some educational materials approached it.  I started talking about that with @koaning in https://github.com/koaning/scikit-fairness/issues/31, and that might be worth checking out.  I'll put something together and share it in this repo at some point.

But if folks have other ideas of a specific real scenario where we could collectively make the case that there is more to be done to create tooling, process and educational support for fairness as a sociotechnical issue, it would be super helpful if you could share them here. 👍 ","2020-05-07 16:07:54","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/413"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","611418402","From scikit-lego to something fair ... and then we heard about this project. Hi all, 

my name is Vincent Warmerdam and together with Matthijs Brouns (@MBrouns) we've started a project called [scikit-lego](https://scikit-lego.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) a while ago. It's a set of scikit-learn compatible tools that we wanted to open source. It's taken off, we hear it is in production, it has 2K downloads a month and we use sklearn's testing framework to keep all the parts compatible. 

Part of that library contained tools that might make models more fair and a while ago we decided it may be best to have these tools in a seperate package. We figured scikit-fairness might be a nice name. Potentially we could make it part of the official scikit-learn contrib landscape and that would perhaps help more folks consider more fair approaches. So we started working ... preview is [here](https://github.com/koaning/scikit-fairness).

On our side, it is our long term goal to make it as simple as possible for somebody new to scikit-learn to be able to pick up tools for fairness. The project will be heavily tutorial driven and there's been interest from DataKind UK to help create content. Odds are that we prefer simpler tooling that is easier to use over state of the art tooling that requires one to be knowledgeable in the field.

Then somebody on github made us aware of this project. We weren't aware of this effort and since there may be overlap in the goals we figured it'd be good to reach out. We were happy to see other efforts to make scikit-learn compatible tools for fairness but it made us wonder what to do with our own package. 

It might make sense to collaborate, then again it might make sense to have multiple packages for fairness but either way we figured it'd be good to check in. 

So out of wonder; 

1. Are you planning on making fairness-learn something that exists inside of scikit-learn-contrib? 
2. Would you argue that your effort is more industry focussed or academia focussed? 
3. What would you say is the long term goal of your package? ","2020-05-03 13:49:16","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/406"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","608695007","Handle exceptions when relabeling results in single class #### Describe the bug
Our reductions methods relabel samples occasionally, so it's possible that a class (label) is entirely erased, resulting in a single class as opposed to two classes (for binary classification). Certain estimators are unable to handle this and throw and exception. Since this isn't unintended from a Fairlearn perspective we should catch this error and handle it appropriately.

#### Steps/Code to Reproduce
Example with `LogisticRegression` as a representative of classifiers that don't work with a single class.
```python
>>> from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
>>> LogisticRegression().fit([[1],[2],[3]], [0,0,0])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
  File ""~\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\sklearn\linear_model\_logistic.py"", line 1558, in fit
    "" class: %r"" % classes_[0])
ValueError: This solver needs samples of at least 2 classes in the data, but the data contains only one class: 0
```

Another example with different error message
```python
>>> from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
>>> GradientBoostingClassifier().fit([[1],[2],[3]], [0,0,0])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
  File ""~\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\sklearn\ensemble\_gb.py"", line 1455, in fit
    y = self._validate_y(y, sample_weight)
  File ""~\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\sklearn\ensemble\_gb.py"", line 2097, in _validate_y
    % n_trim_classes)
ValueError: y contains 1 class after sample_weight trimmed classes with zero weights, while a minimum of 2 classes are required.
```

#### Expected vs. Actual Results
Fairlearn should just skip fitting in this case and use a classifier that always returns the one remaining class.
We received a `ValueError` in the case above. However, even within `sklearn` the returned error messaged isn't consistent as shown above. For that reason we can't assume that we'll be able to check for those error messages. `ValueError` is too generic to simply catch, either. It may be best to first check for the number of unique classes in `y` before calling `fit`.

I see the different sub-projects within the repo, including the JS test app and how it has a mix of static fixture data and randomly generated values.  This works great for some kinds of changes, but not super well for developing semantically meaningful changes.  Earlier I worked around this by writing a script to process a dataset and output more metrics into a static file in [visualization/test/__mock-data](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/tree/master/) and then updated [generateRandomMetrics](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/blob/master/visualization/test/test-page/App.jsx#L36) to read from those new fields.  But this was just hacked-together to understand how the pieces fit together :)

To improve on this, I first tried to see if there ways to develop UI elements within Jupyter.  That would enable using realistic data fed in from Python (as in the demo notebooks).  Installing a local fairlearn package worked on the Python side, but couldn't get this to load updated JS in the visualization folder.  So I looked into the build steps and started trying to see where the problem was.

I changed some localization text within [visualization/FairnessDashboard](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/tree/master/visualization/FairnessDashboard), ran `build_widget.py` and worked through differences on OSX.  But this didn't update the artifacts in the `static` folder that get bundled with the Python package, and it seems like this is because when it builds [fairlearn/widget/js](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/tree/master/fairlearn/widget/js) that project is pinned to a specific published version of the `fairlearn-dashboard` npm package.

So I backed up and tried to use `npm link` to build [fairlearn/widget/js](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/tree/master/fairlearn/widget/js) with the local modified copy of `fairlearn-dashboard`, but I can't get that working.  I can share more specific error messages (some around not being able to `npm install` because of plot.ly type defs, and others around that suggest I'm probably not doing `npm link` right since the build process can't resolve `fairlearn-dashboard`).  but I thought this might be a good point to instead ask how others folks are doing this :)

```Python 
X = check_array(X)
...
return pd.DataFrame(X) 
```
Estimators such as `LightGBM` rely on metadata for categorical columns (column type = `category`) which they process internally more efficiently than by user crafted dummies. The preprocessing function will erase the metadata causing `LightGBM` to process the columns as numerical rather than categorical.

Furthermore, execution of GridSearch fails if there is metadata because of the following two calls:
```
objective.load_data(X_train, y_train, **kwargs) # ln 197
...
current_estimator.fit(X, y_reduction, sample_weight=weights) # ln 237
```
The current estimator is trained on `X` which contains the metadata and the ` objective.gamma` function calls predict on `X_train` which doesn't contain the metadata, which leads to the following error:

One of the issues right now, is that it implements two different cases, one is when the child estimator is already fitted, one is when it's not.

As mentioned in https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/282#discussion_r377255359

> Sorry for a delay on this, but I think that `warm_star` is confusing in this context.

> Just to state the obvious: the high-level semantics of `ThresholdOptimizer` (after it is fitted) is really of a two-stage pipeline. The first step is implemented by `self._estimator.predict()`. It takes as input `X` and returns `y`. The returned `y` is then transformed into `y'` (inside `self.predict()`).

> We would like to enable two styles of fitting this pipeline: (1) fitting both steps from the provided data; or (2) fitting only the second step from the provided data (and using the provided `unconstrained_predictor` as the first step). Now if I think about a warm start, I would expect re-fitting a previously fitted pipeline, using the previous pipeline as a warm start. This to me is quite different from (2), which is just fitting the second stage of the pipeline (from scratch) while keeping the first stage of the pipeline untouched.
> 
> I'm not quite sure I understand the issue with the interaction between the cloning behavior and the `unconstrained_predictor` argument.

This makes it tricky to have a usual sklearn meta-estimator, since cloning the estimator (`ThresholdOptimizer` in this case) does not keep the fitted child estimator. For example, `Pipeline`:

``` python
In [1]: from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline                   

In [2]: from sklearn.svm import SVC                              

In [3]: from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

In [4]: X, y = make_classification()

In [5]: clf = SVC().fit(X, y)

In [6]: Pipeline([('svm', clf)]).predict(X)
Out[6]: 
array([..., 0, 1, 1])

In [7]: from sklearn import clone

In [8]: clone(Pipeline([('svm', clf)])).predict(X)
...

NotFittedError: This SVC instance is not fitted yet. Call 'fit' with appropriate arguments before using this estimator.

```

And that's important since `GridSearchCV` would `clone` the estimators before fitting them.

Another point regarding `warm_start`, is that right now the user has to call `fit` even if the given estimator is pre-fitted. In `sklearn`, we usually assume `warm_start` means the user has called a fit on the estimator already; but here we could use it with a different meaning and assume that the user has passed a pre-fitted estimator. The `warm_start` semantics of sklearn are not very well-defined anyway, and we're still working on them.

__EDIT__

So my proposal is to implement a usual meta-estimator as is in sklearn, and include the `warm_start` parameter to support a pre-fitted estimator.

I think this is a UX bug, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding.  I'll walk through what I see to try to understand if this is an issue or I'm misunderstanding.

### 1. Pick ""precision"" for a disparity metric
Let's say I want to look at my binary classifier and see how precision changes for sensitive attributes.  I think the root UX issue might be that the title copy is asking how I want to measure ""accuracy"" which is an overloaded term on this screen where it has a precise technical meaning:
<img width=""945"" alt=""Screen Shot 2020-02-17 at 1 53 59 PM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1056957/74681384-43556880-5191-11ea-9f25-5630f859ab04.png"">

### 2. Look at model comparisons
This matches what I expect; I see the disparity in precision, which is what I chose.
<img width=""959"" alt=""Screen Shot 2020-02-17 at 1 53 42 PM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1056957/74681492-8a435e00-5191-11ea-9231-468afe529e5a.png"">

### 3. Look at precision by sensitive attribute
On this screen, the header copy says ""Disparity in accuracy,"" which isn't what I expect.  I care about precision, and have been looking at precision, and looking closer, I realize that the chart is actually showing precision.
<img width=""981"" alt=""Screen Shot 2020-02-17 at 1 53 34 PM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1056957/74681527-9af3d400-5191-11ea-8f22-b765ea142454.png"">

I think the root issue is using the term ""accuracy"" in a more informal way, but in this context it already has a precise technical meaning.  If I'm understanding this properly, then one approach could be to rename this ""disparity metric"" or ""focus metric"" or something like that.  Alternately, the initial prompt could be ""How do you want to measure model performance?"" or something that is more generic and doesn't have a specific technical meaning.

> There are many approaches to conceptualizing fairness. In fairlearn, we follow the approach known as group fairness, which asks: Which groups of individuals are at risk for experiencing harms?

Does that mean other definitions of fairness are out of scope, or is that they're not included yet?

Also, are mitigation methods included here inherently incapable of working with other forms of fariness definitions?

Shouldn't it be up to the ethical counsel and lawyers and the local laws to define which types of fairness should be enforced? I'm not sure why this library should take a stand on that.","2020-01-16 15:18:50","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/244"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue","550870116","DOC How is randomization handled The docs say:

> Randomization. In contrast with scikit-learn, estimators in fairlearn can produce randomized predictors. Randomization of predictions is required to satisfy many definitions of fairness. Because of randomization, it is possible to get different outputs from the predictor's predict method on identical data. For each of our methods, we provide explicit access to the probability distribution used for randomization.

`sklearn` does have randomization in many estimators (`RandomForests` as an example :P). But randomness is always controlled by a `random_seed` parameter. Reproducibility requires setting this parameter, to be able to go back and reproduce the results.

It is understandable if in the context of fairness the RNG shouldn't be fixed, but shouldn't the user be able to feed in a seed or a seed and have reproducible results?

Also, the user can set the RNG, and still get probabilistic output given the same input. I could have:

``` python
clf = MyClassifier(random_seed=42)
clf.fit(X, y)
clf.predict(x0) -> returns 0
clf.predict(x0) -> returns 1
```

but if the user runs the same script again, they'll get the same output as before.","2020-01-16 15:11:23","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/243"

The only other way to capture intersectionality is by creating a 1-dimensional grouping vector manually and providing that to Fairlearn. We want to make this easier and allow users to provide an m-dimensional matrix. This needs to be enabled on three levels:

- [x] mitigation techniques
- [x] metrics
- [ ] dashboard

The current implementation for mitigation techniques simply considers all combinations from the `sensitive_features` matrix, e.g. if column A has 4 distinct values and column B has 3 distinct values and all combinations occur we have 4*3=12 groups.

It is possible that users want more fine-grained control, but we'll wait for that feedback. This could mean specifying multiple constraints (demographic parity w.r.t. column A and demographic parity w.r.t. column B, but not intersections of A and B, for example).","2020-01-13 18:03:40","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/237"

Intuitively, it would make sense to binarize this probability at a 0.5 threshold. Not doing this would result in [probability matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_matching), which would result in suboptimal accuracy.

I'm using aequitas for the first time today and i was facing with some issues for launching the audit web-app locally.

To make the command `python -m serve` work, I had to clone the repository and add the following shell environment variable in my terminal `HOST=localhost` because it used in the server.py script. 

I don't know if it was the best way to do it but finally it worked. So i was wondering if it would be possible to update the documentation or to simplify the process for the audit web-app

I am currently looking at src/aequitas/bias.py to find out how the significance is calculated. Here is what I think I understood:

1. Check if sample group is normally distributed
2. a. If sample group is normally distributed, calculate whether sample group and ref. group have equal variances using levene
b. If sample group is not normally distributed, calculate whether sample group and ref. group have equal variances using bartlett
3. a. if both groups have equal variances, perform [independent 2 sample t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test#Independent_two-sample_t-test)
b. if both groups have different variances, perform [Welch's t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_t-test)

I have two questions:
<s>1. Is this correct?</s>
I didn't understand what you mean with ""sample"" group at first. Now I understand that you mean the lists of binary encoded values that say for each entry of each group whether the entry belongs to whichever measure is relevant, fpr or fnr. It canalso be a list of scores, right?

<s>2. Do we not check whether the ref. group is normally distributed? If not, why not? If we do, where?</s>

"https://github.com/dssg/aequitas","issue","651577541","[Solved] meaning of get_crosstabs() param ""score_thresholds"", ""score"" Hi everyone,

I am analyzing whether an API performs equally well for all groups. So I have a data set where I have continuous ""score"" values between 0 and 1. They are predictions made by the API for it's result being correct. Then there is the ""label_value"" which is either 0 (meaning that the API result was incorrect) or 1 (meaning that the API result was correct). 

Now if I calculate the true positives for instance for women by hand I do:
`f_tp = df[((df['sex'] == 'Female') & (df['label_value'] == 1) & (df['score'] >= t))]`
where t is my treshold of 0.8. So I consider a score of 0.8 to be a prediction of being correct.

I do similar stuff to calculate tn, fp, fn:
```
f_tn = df[((df['sex'] == 'Female') & (df['label_value'] == 0) & (df['score'] < t))]
f_fp = df[((df['sex'] == 'Female') & (df['label_value'] == 0) & (df['score'] >= t))]
f_fn = df[((df['sex'] == 'Female') & (df['label_value'] == 1) & (df['score'] < t))]
```

And I obtain:
* tp = 1185
* tn = 43
* fp = 63
* fn = 104

Now I would like to make these calculations automatically using Aequitas.
```
g = Group()
xtab, _ = g.get_crosstabs(df, attr_cols=[""sex""], score_thresholds= {'score': [0.8]})
```
In the result, I get values similar to those I got by hand but they are switched around :
* tp = 104
* tn = 63
* fp = 43
* fn = 1185

Here, tp is what I considered to be fn and fn is what I considered to be tp. What I considered to be tn is fp and what I considered to be fp is tn. 

I can't quite wrap my mind around this. What am I missing? I think I might be confusing something? I'd be so happy if you could give me a hint.

- The Python API preprocessing input statement is incorrect, it should be `from Aequitas.preprocessing import preprocess_input_df`, i.e. preprocess_input_df should not be callable

- The documentation says that attribute columns can be categorical or continuous, this is confusing in terms of when cleaning functions are called in the pre-processing step. For instance I had made age categories using the cut function that returned a categorical datatype, which caused the discretize cleaning function to be called which then threw an error. It should be clear that categorical columns must be converted to strings.

- Import statements are missing for the Plot and Bias modules; the docs should include `from aequitas.bias import Bias` and `from aequitas.plotting import Plot` in those example calls. 

- The call for the visualization of the disparity treemaps doesn't work as is, it should be `j = p.plot_disparity_all(....` rather than `j = aqp.plot_disparity_all(...` to match the earlier use of Plot().

Hey there,

I have noticed that the constrained model in the CelebA example Notebook has a horrible positive rate: 0.1 @ 0.5 threshold.

I expected that the model would perform at least equally good on this metric.

I think the error is logical, because in the mse function, I think you are doing the reshape as if it was only a one class situation. However, for my case the output_constant_col and the normal_black_box_output is of size (17356,2).  So I am working in a 2 class classification scenario.

  I tried using this package, and in the total dictionary I only got constant vectors. I digged a bit in the code and it seems like in line 217 in orthogonal_projection.py, you pass ptb_strategy=""constant-zero""to replace_column_of_matrix no matter what the user has selected as direct_input_pertubation_strategy. This means the algorithm produces the exact same number in each iteration no matter what.
So in line 217 in orthogonal_projection.py, ""constant-zero"" should be replaced by direct_input_pertubation_strategy.

In addition the comments are not consistent with what the algorithm actually does.
In line 132 in orthogonal_projection.py you have:
direct_input_pertubation_strategy -> This is referring to how to zero out a
                            single variable. One of three different options
                            1) replace with a random constant value
                            2) replace with median constant value
                            3) replace all values with a random permutation of
                               the column.  options = [constant-zero,
                               constant-median, global-permutation]

While in reality, you should have:

                               options = [constant-zero, constant-median, random-sample]

Also the first option, which is the default is not very smart, given that 0 might not even be in the range of the variable.

"https://github.com/adebayoj/fairml","issue","339879675","Code not consistent with thesis Hi,
  In your thesis, somewhere you say that : four different algorithms, listed below, are run to rank the importance of all features. Each ranking algorithm produces a score for each feature. The four sets of scores obtained from the ranking algorithms are then aggregated into a combined score for each feature. The final ranking of a feature is determined by the combined score obtained. The results can then be scaled and ploted. The ranking algorithms consist of:
1.	 Iterative Orthogonal Feature Projection Algorithm (IOFP)
2.	minimum Redundancy, Maximum Relevance Feature Selection (mRMR)
3.	Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)
4.	Random Forest (RF)

However in the audit_model function which seems to be the main function, which is implemented in orthogonal_projection.py, you seem to only implement 1 and 2 and then return the results as 2 dictionaries. Am I correct and there is an inconsistency between the documentation and the code or have I misunderstood something?

"https://github.com/adebayoj/fairml","issue","213607391","`direct_input_pertubation_strategy=` isn't passed down Nice method.

I am examining the code and the thesis more closely as it appears to be very useful.

I don't fully understand the point of perturbation strategy and it's not fully expanded on in the thesis.

I started reading the code and I spotted some bugs.

Firstly

https://github.com/adebayoj/fairml/blob/master/fairml/orthogonal_projection.py#L120

takes the strategy but ignores it, see:

https://github.com/adebayoj/fairml/blob/master/fairml/orthogonal_projection.py#L217

Also, I think that with constant_zero and median perturbation strategies this loop is redundant:

https://github.com/adebayoj/fairml/blob/master/fairml/orthogonal_projection.py#L205

As each run ignores `random_sample_selected` anyway, so each run *should* produce the same `output_difference_col` and `total_difference`. (because `data_col_ptb` and `total_ptb_data` are identical each run).

Finally, it would be great if you could explain more in the documentation the purpose of `direct_input_pertubation_strategy`. Is it necessary at all to ""zero-out"" a column? Why?

It appears to me that just by orthogonalising other columns you already take away the effect of the subject column. Not clear to me why zero'ing out is required on top. Is it to be certain the effect of the column is not present?

`+` - positive label
`-` - negative label

- large weights are assigned to `X_s1_y+` and `X_s0_y–`:

Therefore, in a discriminatory dataset the term `(p(s1) * p(+)) / p(s1 and +)` will evaluate to `> 1` since the actual probability of being `s1` and `+` is less than the expected probability under the independence assumption.

Conversly, `(p(s1) * p(-)) / p(s1 and -)` will evaluate to `< 1` since the actual probability of being `s1` and `-` is greater than the expected probability under the independence assumption.","2017-08-30 04:06:31","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/11"

  where `0.5 < theta < 1`, `X_s1` (disadvantaged observations) are assigned as `y+` and
  X_s0 (advantaged observations are assigned as `y –`.

**Multi-classifier Setting**

ROC in the multiple classifier setting is similar to the single classifier setting, except that predicted probabilities are defined as the weighted average of probabilities generated by each classifier `C_k` (k is the number of different classifiers trained), where the weights can be defined as:

- the accuracy of the classifier on the data.
- uniform (take the mean of the predictions)

I have been working on a multi-class classification problem. I used the following metrics with the pos_class parameter for all the classes one by one but the values are same for all the classes.

1. AbsCV
2. Accuracy
3. Average Odds Difference
4. Balanced Classification Rate
5. CV
6. F1-score
7. NMI
8. RenyiCorrelation
9. SklearnMetric (for few metrics)
10. Theil Index
11. Yanovich 

On further investigation, I figured out that the Theil index is calculated for the class having maximum instances while other metrics are calculated for Y=1.

Please let me know whether the above mentioned metrics support multi-class classification or not. If yes, then how can I use it and if not, are you planning to have it in the next release.   ","2021-05-12 13:40:15","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/431"

"https://github.com/predictive-analytics-lab/EthicML","issue","678539449","Proposal: Multiple S ### Abstract
We currently only really support one group of binary S values. FairML literature has a large gap in terms of analysis of a more real-world setup: multiple groups of S. This proposal is for multiple S groups, which in turn are exclusive, to be supported.

For example, currently we have `{gender=0, gender=1}`. This has recently been extended to include more than one sensitive group, `{race0-gender0=0, race1-gender0=1, race2-gender0=2, race0-gender1=3, race1-gender1=4, race2-gender1=5}`. 

This proposal is to formalise this process a little.

### Motivation 
Fairness and Equality laws around the world consider multiple sensitive groups. For example you should be fair with regard to race, gender AND religion (amongst others). But how to best represent this? 

### Specification 

The recent approach is to combine all potential groups giving N sensitive values. During training we can potentially OHE the sensitive value, and during evaluation we can then treat the result as a (1v1/1vA) binary problem. Throughout we can use a lookup table to map back from 3 -> race=1, gender=1. This lookup table would exist as part of the created Dataset object.

#### Lookup Table

The lookup table should map between 2 tables. One which is held in DataTupleInstance.s, and another, more readable one

_DataTupleInstance.s_
| Index | S |
|:-----:|:-:|
|     0 | 0 |
|     1 | 4 |
|     2 | 3 |
|     3 | 1 |
|     4 | 3 |
|     5 | 5 |
|     6 | 2 |
| ...| ...|

There should be a mapping between these 2 tables

_readable_
|       | Gender  |         | Race  |       | |
|-------|---------|---------|-------|-------|-----|
| Index | Gender0 | Gender1 | Race0 | Race1 | Race2 |
|     0 |    1    | 0       | 1     | 0     | 0 |
|     1 |    0    | 1       | 0     | 1     | 0 |
|     2 |    0    | 1       | 1     | 0     | 0 |
|     3 |    1    | 0       | 0     | 1     | 0 |
|     4 |    0    | 1       | 1     | 0     | 0 |
|     5 |    0    | 1       | 0     | 0     | 1 |
|     6 |    1    | 0       | 0     | 0     | 1 |
|     ... |   ...    | ...       | ...     | ...     | ... |

Why multi-hierarchy? This will make it easier to look at just Gender, or just Race

#### Evaluation Metrics
If you're woking on intersectional data groups, then we will need this mapping to produce metrics that are readable. The `run_metrics` helper should optionally accept a Dataset object. If it receives this, then the data should be unpacked prior to reporting the values. If a dataset is not provided, then the evaluations should not try to map from a number `15` to a text description `sex=value0,gender=value0,nationality=value15`.

### Rejected Ideas 

Not collapsing the intersectional groups and leaving just the hierarchical 

### Outstanding Problems

How to extend to continuous S? - We don't have any datasets where this is the case, so not a primary concern.

What if, as a user, I don't want to create a lookup mechanism? I just want to get some metrics for the data I put in? - These lookup tables will be provided for all datasets in EthicML. Unless you're loading in your own data directly into a DataTuple, in which case if no Dataset is provided to one of the evaluation helpers, then the values are assumed to belong to one S group.

What if I have an S group which has no value, or a missing value? This will need to be remedied prior to using EthicML. We assume that each sensitive group has exactly one value per row.","2020-08-13 15:43:53","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/353"

NamedTuple on the other hand have a fixed number of fields and all fields are mandatory:

```python
from typing import NamedTuple
import pandas as pd

class DataTuple(NamedTuple):
    x: pd.DataFrame
    y: pd.DataFrame
    s: pd.DataFrame
```

They are instantiated as follows:

```python
data = DataTuple(x=df1, y=df2, s=df3)
```

The values are accessed like this:
```python
data.x
```

Finally, NamedTuple are *immutable*. This: `data.x = df4` throws an error.","2019-02-20 18:10:37","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/16"

"https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360","issue_comment","698869678","Because I ran the install on a Windows 8.1 laptop with R version 3.6.3, I thought I'd give it a try on a Windows 10 laptop with the latest stable R version. I also decided to run R with administrative privileges.  I executed the following code:
```
install.packages('aif360')
library(aif360)
install_aif360()
```
When the system asked me to install Miniconda, I said 'Yes'.
I didn't get an error this time, only a warning telling me that I should add `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\R-MINI~1\envs\R-RETI~1\Scripts` to my `PATH` variable, so I did.

Subsequently I executed `load_aif360()`. This also generated an error:
```

I ignored the warning and executed this line of code:

An error was returned:

"https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360","issue_comment","625285491","Hi
I think the results you are getting are an artifact of the dataset itself. The Adult dataset that is produced by load_preproc_data_adult() has only two discretized features (plus the sensitive features). I suspect eta has a minimal impact on the model and so PR is probably not a good model for it.
If you use the full Adult dataset (using dataset_orig = AdultDataset()), you will see that eta has an effect on fairness pretty quickly. Be sure to scale the features since PR uses regularized LR.
For example,
scaler = StandardScaler()
dataset_orig_train.features = scaler.fit_transform(dataset_orig_train.features)
dataset_orig_test.features = scaler.transform(dataset_orig_test.features)

Thanks for looking into this, Prasanna. I hope you can help me out if I have missed some steps.

This was the code I used: 

```
privileged_groups, unprivileged_groups = get_attributes(data_train, selected_attr=[priv_category])
sess = tf.Session()

debiased_model = AdversarialDebiasing(privileged_groups = privileged_groups,
                          unprivileged_groups = unprivileged_groups,
                          scope_name='debiased_classifier',

                          debias=True, sess=sess)

debiased_model.fit(data_train)

data_pred = debiased_model.predict(data_test)
```

Running above code once returns fine but running it a second time, say for example just to change parameters or doing a `.fit()` on a different dataset returns:

"https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360","issue_comment","596740349","@jimbudarz, if you encode your categorical data with `pd.get_dummies()`, or use `StandardDataset`, you will end up with `feature_names` that look like, e.g., `[..., native-country=United-States, native-country=Vietnam, native-country=Yugoslavia, ...]`. Then, if you do `convert_to_dataframe(de_dummy_code=True)`, you will get a DataFrame that looks something like:
```
  ... native-country
0 ... United-States
1 ... United-States
2 ... Vietnam
...
```
with the columns magically mapped from one-hot to categories.

You can also include maps for the labels and protected attributes manually (since these are encoded differently) by supplying them when creating the BinaryLabelDataset (note: `protected_attribute_maps` should be in the same order as `protected_attribute_names`):
```
metadata = {
    'label_maps': [{1.0: '>50K', 0.0: '<=50K'}],
    'protected_attribute_maps': [{1.0: 'White', 0.0: 'Non-white'},
                                 {1.0: 'Male', 0.0: 'Female'}]

"https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360","issue_comment","594767800","I believe the first comment by @vsahil is based on the notebooks in the examples folder. The reason why we choose to this custom preprocessing for optimized preprocessing is because we want small number of features and small number of categories per feature. It just gives more compact datasets (in terms of features). This is mainly for computational/statistical reasons since the probability estimates used in optimized pre-processing will not be good otherwise. For the other notebooks, sometimes we choose to use smaller datasets to limit runtime, else travis will not be able to execute them fast enough during testing.

Also, generally speaking, the notebooks are just an example of how we can implement various bias mitigation methods, and are by no means the only way to do things. Other approaches of loading data can be definitely tried out. However, like in all ML/data science approaches, choosing the right kind of data pre-processing for the algorithm is question may take a few trials of experimentation.

Would be ideal if a prediction attribute exists which is used instead of updating the label attrbute.

Challenges/workarounds:
- @adrinjalali mentioned some relevant feature additions under review on scikit-learn:
    - resampling API: https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/15
    - feature names: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13307
    - sample properties: https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/16
- Until these are added to a stable release, there are some workarounds for some of these issues:
    - Using Pandas DataFrames to store sample properties in the index of y values

Next steps:
- Move changes to a single branch in AIF360
- Start by converting metrics to scorers using workarounds, if needed
- Convert as many algorithms to Estimators as possible
- Push for sklearn PRs mentioned above and any additional necessary functionality
- Swap out code in large chunks (e.g. all metrics at once) in the master branch to ensure a useable state at each release

Future considerations:
- Will backward-compatibility be an issue for users?
- Add ""nightly"" release with features as we go?
- Get sklearn-contrib status?

For these projects, we use the scikit-learn-contrib collection or projects to give more visibility to those projects, and aif360, or a variation of it, would be a perfect match there.

There are some constraints that we need to satisfy before that. For instance, I don't think we should have a hard dependency on tensorflow, specially since it doesn't even support python3.7 yet, and by the time it does, python3.8 is probably out. Also, there seem to be some focus on python2.7 support here which is ditched already in many parts of the ecosystem (pandas and sklearn included). We're planning a release in the coming week and it supports python3.5+.

```
  lint:
    docker:

Thanks for opening this issue and finding this bug! `sample_params` is expecting array-like parameters with length matching that of `y_true` and `y_pred`. Unfortunately, passing in `pos_label` as an array (e.g. `""pos_label"" = [pos_label]*len(y_true)`) won't fix the problem since the `false_positive_rate` function is expecting `pos_label` to be a scalar value.

It should be a simple fix on our end to update the `MetricFrame` to accept scalar and array-like values for `sample_params`.

My immediate thought is that bootstrapping isn't really anything to do with `MetricFrame` - couldn't the approach you're describing be made into a wrapper around any metric? Then that metric could be placed in a `MetricFrame` like any other.

**However**, that would force the 'DataFrame of tuples' return type, rather than the 'dictionary of DataFrames' you propose. If people feel that the latter return type would be more useful, then the approach described here seems reasonable. It is possible that my instinct to compartmentalise is operating excessively.

> My immediate thought is that bootstrapping isn't really anything to do with MetricFrame - couldn't the approach you're describing be made into a wrapper around any metric? Then that metric could be placed in a MetricFrame like any other.

An advantage of adding bootstrapping directly to `MetricFrame` is that it creates a lot less overhead for the user, especially if you have a bunch of them. And, not unimportantly, it is much easier to locate compared to a separate function. It also opens up some opportunities to automatically ignore the CI's in e.g., `'overall'` or `difference()`, which could avoid some hard-to-interpret results (see also below).

> At the risk of displaying my ignorance of statistics, I would like to know a bit more about the significance testing part. My default assumption is that if two numbers have overlapping error bars, then they're not significantly different. It sounds like that's not the case?

As far as I understand, the ""problem"" is that bootstrapping gives a confidence interval around the estimates for each group separately (e.g., *p_a* and *p_b*). Because you do not make any assumptions about the distributions (e.g., that they're normally distributed), the overlap of these estimates does not correspond directly to the null hypothesis of comparing means. To use bootstrapping as a hypothesis test I believe you'd need to run the procedure to get an estimation of the *difference* between the groups  (*p_a* - *p_b*) directly. But perhaps somebody who understand this on a deeper level can explain it better :)

This does correspond to a point briefly discussed in last week's community call: our documentation needs to be *super* clear about what you can and cannot conclude from these confidence intervals. Given that the entire goal of `MetricFrame` is to compare groups, it is very natural that people *will* (visually) compare the confidence intervals as an informal hypothesis test, even if we add a warning that they shouldn't. 

Tagging @fairlearn/fairlearn-maintainers 

[A final note not directly relevant to this discussion but so we don't forget:] @MiroDudik also remarked that even if we would add functionality for formal hypothesis testing, statistical significance is not necessarily equal to practical relevance (if your sample is big enough, you'll always find a statistically significant difference). So if we go that route we might want to go for e.g., equivalence testing, where you need to specify beforehand what you'd consider a relevant difference.","2021-12-06 09:43:29","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/999#issuecomment-986605129"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","988339920","Hi @riedgar-ms and @hildeweerts, 

Thanks for taking the time to provide such thoughtful feedback! Here's my take on a few of the questions raised: 

> My immediate thought is that bootstrapping isn't really anything to do with MetricFrame - couldn't the approach you're describing be made into a wrapper around any metric? Then that metric could be placed in a MetricFrame like any other.""

I agree with @hildeweerts' response here -- my feeling is that direct integration means less work for the user in both setting up the analysis and in post-processing results afterwards. A dataframe of tuples is particularly nasty to work with, and will break many existing pandas/numpy workflows users may depend on. In addition, it makes plotting with error bars significantly more tedious as well.

Because you do not make any assumptions about the distributions (e.g., that they're normally distributed), the overlap of these estimates does not correspond directly to the null hypothesis of comparing means. To use bootstrapping as a hypothesis test I believe you'd need to run the procedure to get an estimation of the difference between the groups (p_a - p_b) directly. But perhaps somebody who understand this on a deeper level can explain it better :)

Completely agree with @hildeweerts here as well! Hypothesis testing frameworks also often take into account the number of samples present in each group, which the simple bootstrap based error bars don't explicitly account for. In addition, things get even more complex when doing multiple comparisons (for example, a sensitive feature like 'Race' may have 5-10+ different levels to it). Checking for error bar overlap doesn't intuitively translate to probabilities in these settings. 

> This does correspond to a point briefly discussed in last week's community call: our documentation needs to be super clear about what you can and cannot conclude from these confidence intervals. Given that the entire goal of MetricFrame is to compare groups, it is very natural that people will (visually) compare the confidence intervals as an informal hypothesis test, even if we add a warning that they shouldn't.

This is a really important point. On top of documentation on the website, are there any other mechanisms that FairLearn uses to alert users about these types of pitfalls (e.g. warnings or visualization hints)?

* I'm in favor of this being part of `MetricFrame`. First, because of convenience, but more importantly, because we really need to be able to obtain error bars on `difference()`, `ratio()`, `group_max()`, and `group_min()`. The error bars on those are particularly important for the ability to quantify fairness.

* Also, I agree that we should document how we suggest that the data scientist view these error bars. For example, when comparing, say, false positive rate (FPR) on two segments of population, the data scientist shouldn't be necessarily looking for the overlap, but instead should be looking at what's the **worst case** difference between those two groups (i.e., the opposite of the overlap).

* Basically, in the context of fairness, we are not worried that the point estimates are too pessimistic, we are actually worried that the point estimates might be too optimistic, and so with error bars on subpopulations, we are looking at their extreme values. If the error bars are too big, this means that we have too little data--and with the data that we have, it might be the case that the two subpopulations have indeed starkly different FPRs even if their error bars overlap (if their error bars are also big).

* Another usage of the `MetricFrame` with error bars is to examine the error bars of `difference()` (or some of the other aggregates), and again the focus should be on the worst case. This can be even turned into a statistical test. If we get a 95%-confidence interval [*a*,*b*] for the value of the difference, we can reject the hypothesis that `difference()`>*b* at *p*=0.05 (in fact we might get a better *p*, because the test is one-sided, whereas the confidence interval is two-sided).","2021-12-09 22:28:58","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/999#issuecomment-990352716"

Yes! That's exactly what I had in mind -- it should work reasonably well even if we have many groups, because we don't have to worry about multiple hypothesis testing. However, we'll need to ensure that we deal correctly (that means conservatively) with some bad cases. The main bad case is when the number of data points in one of the subgroups, say *G* is too small. This can demonstrate in a variety of ways. Two extreme examples that come to mind:
* Some of the bootstrap replicates have no data points in *G*. (This could be prevented by stratification.)
* The sample variance (in the overall dataset) within group *G* is artificially small. This can happen for example when the value of the metric is 0/1 and we have too few data points and they are all 0s or all 1s. Another extreme case is when we have only one data point from some group (its sample variance is then obviously 0).

I am not aware of how to address the latter point in the fully distribution-free manner. The most appealing approach to me would be to allow the user specify the range of values that the metric can take (e.g., [0,1] in case of the binary metrics), which seems like a minimal information that would then allow us to construct conservative confidence intervals. Plus we would issue warnings if we detect sample sizes too small and the metric ranges are not specified.  (Another alternative would be to go Bayesian and construct credible intervals, but perhaps we can keep that for future.)

@hildeweerts, I'm expanding on your question so quoting it here:

> Just to make sure I understand this correctly, the error bars on `difference()` would be computed by bootstrapping the difference, right?

I think this is a natural plan for the 2 groups setting, but I have a few questions about the case when there are >2 groups. I believe the current `.difference()` implementation adaptively chooses the maximum disparity between any two observed groups. For group/metric combinations with high variance and similar point estimates, the two groups chosen for the absolute difference calculation may change between bootstrap iterations if we just use the built-in fairlearn utility as a subroutine.

A natural solution here might be to fix the two groups chosen for the difference before doing bootstrap. We can use the entire dataset to estimate the groups with the largest differences in point estimates and fix those as the chosen ""differencing"" groups.

But in terms of the hypothesis testing translation, I think it's important to note that this would only be valid for the comparison between the two groups chosen. Take the case of the ""2nd largest"" group, for example, which may have a smaller mean but maybe a significantly larger variance than the ""largest"" group. This ""2nd largest"" group may very well have a significant disparity with another group, even if the two groups chosen for differencing don't have one. 

It could very well be that this is a pathological case and not worth considering too carefully, but I believe it gets increasingly more likely as the number of groups grows. 

One other option is to explicitly run the bootstrap difference on every pairwise combination of groups, and simply log all results. This increases the runtime cost, but we could then adaptively choose at the end of the bootstrap which groups we want to publish a .difference() summary for, instead of choosing before we know the metric variances on each group. Or even allow users to access all pairwise difference distributions. Would appreciate any thoughts on this!

I don't think we should fix the two groups in advance. We should basically calculate the `difference()` value separately for each bootstrap replicate and then report the confidence intervals of that statistic, and be clear in our documentation that we do this and what it means.

For a comparison of two specific groups, we could consider creating a new aggregator, maybe called ""deviation()"" or ""pairwise_difference()"" that would return all-pairs **signed** differences in the form of a skew-symmetric matrix, and we could then possibly construct separate confidence intervals for each of the matrix entries. However, I'm thinking that this should be proposed and discussed in a separate issue. (Thoughts on this?) Practically speaking, since our groups are non-overlapping, we can construct conservative confidence intervals for the signed differences just using confidence intervals for individual groups... of course, multiple hypothesis issues arise when interpreting such all-pairs difference matrix.","2021-12-10 15:29:15","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/999#issuecomment-991066734"

Could you expand a bit more on this @MiroDudik? It is not entirely clear to me why this approach would alleviate issues with multiple hypothesis testing. It seems like you'd still need to repeat the bootstrapping procedure for all pairs of groups and adjust the significance levels accordingly. Or do you mean that you would compute one confidence interval for the difference between *any* two groups? I am a bit worried that such a result wouldn't be very informative/actionable - if there *is* a difference, you'd probably want to investigate more fine grained results anyways.","2021-12-10 16:36:35","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/999#issuecomment-991120203"

I'm very much in favor of this project since we're not doing a good job at providing the information on why this dataset may not be ideal to use as a benchmark. Of course, your paper (and repo) add several alternative datasets which could be added to `fairlearn.datasets`. More on that below.

I'd also encourage breaking it down into as many pieces as possible. In my own experience (see many PRs of mine) it's a lot easier to add a small change/addition rather than a big chunk since all reviewers need to be satisfied and the more content there is the more there is to disagree on.

I see several pieces here:
- documenting the existing Adult dataset - all we have right now is https://fairlearn.org/main/api_reference/fairlearn.datasets.html#fairlearn.datasets.fetch_adult . A more elaborate exploration would probably go into the user guide. 
- Uploading the new datasets to OpenML
- Adding functions to the `datasets` module to import the OpenML datasets with a basic docstring
- Adding context on why these new datasets are in some ways preferable to the existing adult dataset either in the user guide or through an example.

Note: #961 is currently adding a datasets section in the user guide to which some of this could be added.

I would be a bit reluctant to replace the adult dataset in the ""get started"" guide because we were planning to use a synthetic dataset there, based on #907. The rationale in short is that when you don't have the time to explain the context, don't use the data.

Would it make sense to add and argument for error handling behavior to `MetricFrame`, similar to what we have for e.g., `difference()`: `error` with options `'raise'` (raise error, possibly with a more meaningful error message compared to the current situation), and `'coerce'` (return `NaN` for the group for which AUC is undefined).","2021-10-06 14:20:26","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/972#issuecomment-936325576"

We could perhaps improve the error from `_create_group_metric_set()` (well, to be precise, we can yank that from Fairlearn, since it doesn't really belong there any more), but I don't see how it can be done in `MetricFrame`.

I've only had time for a very quick skim through, but from what you've written it sounds like CDD should be implemented using a `MetricFrame` internally. Basically, use `MetricFrame` as an easy way of getting the metric applied to all the splits, and then process them according to the requirements of CDD. Since the denominators are based on 'whole group' numbers, I don't think that CDD could be usefully implemented as a metric function *passed into* `MetricFrame`.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","936156824","I think we've seen several use cases now for which having the option to somehow retrieve counts from `MetricFrame` would be useful. I think one way to achieve this would be to have a `compute_counts=True` argument in `MetricFrame` that controls the property `mf.counts` that stores the counts per group (or whatever we want to call these). I would personally prefer such a construction to an `mf.count()` function that ""pretends"" to compute things that have already been computed.

From the paper: *""Conditional demographic disparity differs from demographic disparity only in the sense that one or more additional conditions are added. For example, if we condition on grade point average (GPA) and we admit 70% of white applicants to graduate school that had a 4.0 GPA, conditional demographic parity would be satisfied only if 70% of black applicants with a 4.0 GPA were also admitted.""*

I haven't had the time to dive into the actual formulation (and I find the description from AWS/in the paper a bit confusing), but this specific example suggests to me that conditional demographic disparity is the weighted average of `demographic_parity_difference` across some 'explaining' feature. This is closely related to the `control_features` argument in `MetricFrame`. If this would be true, the only thing we would still require is the option to compute the weighted average over the `control_features` in `mf.by_group`.","2021-10-06 12:38:11","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/971#issuecomment-936156824"

![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{n^0_d}{n^0}-\frac{n^1_d}{n^1})

where the first term is the fraction of all 0 predictions that belong to a group `d`, and the second term is the fraction of all 1 predictions that belong to the same group `d`. So in that formula you get 0 if you have demographic parity in the sense that we've implemented. They add the individual values up for all the groups weighted by group size.

@hildeweerts conditioning isn't mentioned like that in the AWS documentation. I agree with your assessment, though, especially since the example you cite clearly uses conditioning on GPA. Definitely sounds like a case for `control_features`.

In terms of performing the actual aggregation, I'm not so sure whether/how that should be done. We can certainly define a `MetricFrame` that computes the counts for all groups, but would we aggregate them separately per control feature value, or even across control groups? Note that the example you cited only talks about the applicants with 4.0 GPA, but not any others. That is actually consistent with our control features because we aggregate only within the control group, but not across (see https://fairlearn.org/v0.7.0/user_guide/assessment.html#control-features-for-grouped-metrics).

I think the conditioning aspect is hidden in the part where they talk about subgroups:
* *""A conditional demographic disparity (CDD) metric that **conditions DD on attributes that define a strata of subgroups on the dataset** is needed to rule out Simpson's paradox.*
* *""The CDD metric gives a single measure for all of the disparities found in the subgroups defined by an attribute of a dataset by averaging them. ""*

So when they talk about subgroups here, they do **not** mean sensitive subgroups (I think they use ""facet"" for that).

> The `weighted_average` would just be another way of aggregating in addition to group_min, group_max, ratio, and difference, wouldn't it?

It's a slightly different aggregation because you compute it *after* one of the other aggregations you mention, so you'd need to have something like  `mf.weighted_average(method='difference')`.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","948969679","Let me start a bit broader with my response...

I looked at the paper. Let's ignore control feature for a moment. As you've probably noticed, there is a key difference in how they operationalize standard demographic parity (but it's equivalent to ours!):

* Our definition of demographic parity:
  * **P[Y=1 | A=a] = P[Y=1]** for all **a**.
* Their (equivalent) definition:
  * **P[A=a | Y=1] = P[A=a | Y=0]** for all **a**.
* An equivalent rewrite of their definition:
  * **P[A=a | Y=1] = P[A=a]** for all **a**.

With this definition in mind, they focus on measuring the amount of ""disadvantage"" as experienced by a specific ""protected group"" **a**. We could do likewise. This gives rise to the following ""disadvantage"" metrics:

* Our metric for disadvantage of **a**:
  * **P[Y=0 | A=a] - P[Y=0]**, which is equal to **P[Y=1] - P[Y=1 | A=a]**
* Their approach gives rise to three possible disadvantage metrics (they seem to focus on the first one):
  * **P[A=a | Y=0] - P[A=a | Y=1]**
  * **P[A=a | Y=0] - P[A=a]**
  * **P[A=a] - P[A=a | Y=1]**

Our disadvantage is a disaggregated metric (because we condition on ""A=a""), but their disadvantage is NOT a disaggregated metric, so I don't think that there should be a natural way how to use `MetricFrame` with just a single metric to get a `pandas.Series` that would list their disadvantage for each group.

In terms of next steps re. implementing this, I see three possibilities:
1. Create an example where we create a suitable `MetricFrame` and then show how to use that metric frame to calculate the disadvantage of each group. I expect that such a metric frame would be using these metrics:
```
metrics = {'n' : fairlearn.metrics.count,
           'n_Y0': lambda y_true, y_pred: np.sum(1-y_true),
           'n_Y1': lambda y_true, y_pred: np.sum(y_true)}
```
2. Create a new class that would calculate the disadvantages of the groups, using a similar API as `MetricFrame`.
3. Create a new function, e.g., instead of `demographic_parity_difference`, it could be called something like `demgraphic_parity_disadvantage` or something like that...

Once we settle on one of the above three, the question of aggregation across control features should be much more straightforward.","2021-10-21 20:15:11","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/971#issuecomment-948969679"

I might be biased because I'm so used to demographic parity difference by now, but I find it much more difficult to interpret their metric compared to ours. If we disregard the part about GPA in [the example](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues/971#issuecomment-936156824) I mentioned earlier, it seems like even the authors themselves also prefer the, in my view, more natural comparison of selection rates across groups.

* If you have access to population level marginals **P[A=a]** as well as access to data data with Y=1 (say only know who was admitted to some program / hired / received a loan), but not Y=0 (who was rejected), then you can evaluate **P[A=a]-P[A=a|Y=1]** but you cannot evaluate **P[Y=1|A]**.

IMO the deterministic version of exposure makes sense, but I'd love to hear other people's thoughts on this as well @fairlearn/fairlearn-maintainers. Could you give an example of how utility would be defined in scenario (2)?

As a side note, I think we need to be careful with overloading terminology. Demographic parity/disparate treatment* are typically use I n the context of classification and regression problems. To avoid confusion, I think it would make sense to instead focus on the *types of harm* that are being measured. E.g., differences in exposure can be seen as a measure of allocation harm in a ranking scenario, whereas differences in exposure/utility is an indicator of quality-of-service harm.

Reject Option Classification is a technique based on the intuitive hypothesis that discriminatory decisions are often made close to the decision boundary because of the decision maker’s bias. 

To tackle this problem, the authors focus on a critical region around the decision boundary. This critical region contains all instances for which: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50204600/134129829-d0ca7019-e61a-4134-877c-fa34bb403d64.png)

Outside of the critical region labeling is done in the normal manner, that is: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50204600/134130562-56dffca6-a931-4be6-91ab-9d88cb0c143f.png)

Inside of the critical region, the labels are assigned as follows:

The algorithm requires neither modification of the learning algorithm nor preprocessing of historical data. Pretrained classifiers can be made discrimination-aware at prediction time. Furthermore, it is not restricted to a particular classifier, it works with any probabilistic classifier.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","923835088","Thanks @bramreinders97 ! This sounds like postprocessing with special treatment in this particular region. Many unfairness mitigation algorithms have this ""advantaged""/""disadvantaged"" or ""deprived"" terminology which is binary AFAICT and doesn't match how we've approached things so far. For example, if you have 3 groups (or more), and on some metric (say, accuracy) they are at 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6, then would the first two groups be ""deprived""? Or just the first one? Perhaps different thresholds (theta) per group? 

Taking a step back, this somewhat reminds me of the `ThresholdOptimizer` in terms of the result. There, we end up with per-group thresholds (not exactly single thresholds, but rather two between which we interpolate using probabilities) to equalize certain target metrics.

So I'm curious how this applies to more than 2 groups w.r.t. creating thresholds and - based on that - what you're thinking in terms of API.","2021-09-21 10:13:02","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/958#issuecomment-923835088"

I'm also a bit confused about `classifiers`. What are we doing with multiple ones here? I had (perhaps mistakenly) assumed we're dealing with a single one.

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding, so let me draw up a simple example and you tell me if this matches your expectation:

Let's say we have 2 groups, A and B. A is in your terminology privileged and B is unprivileged. So let's say we manually choose theta as 0.6 after some consideration. Then our classifier would output some probabilities for every sample and we postprocess them as

- 1, if sample is from group A and probability is >0.6 or sample is from group B and probability is > 0.4
- 0 otherwise.

I can even extend that to more groups, but to me this sounds like a set of manually configured thresholds. I don't quite see the need to call any group privileged or unprivileged, since that would get messy pretty quickly. As I mentioned before, what do you call the ""in between"" groups, ""somewhat privileged""? It would be simpler to just list all the thresholds without the ""privilege"" associations (unless we're discussing something in written text where I don't see such issues).

Beyond that, is there a particular reason why the critical region needs to be symmetric? I don't particularly see why it shouldn't be 0.4 and 0.55, for example. If we have more than two groups that's bound to happen anyway, isn't it?

Finally, this seems to assume that we know the sensitive features at predict time, correct? The same applies to the `ThresholdOptimizer`, but it's not a nice property since it requires you to have these features at predict time. For example, `ExponentiatedGradient` doesn't need them at predict time. It's not a problem for the implementation, I just want to make sure I understand.

Theta should indeed be moved out of `predict`.  If it would be set in the constructor, we would not need a `fit` method I think. I had a meeting with @hildeweerts this morning, and she mentioned having a `fit` method is standard practice, but we should also think about how users might use our algorithm in a pipeline, and base our choice on that. Conclusion: I'm not sure yet where to put it (except that it should go out of `predict`). 

> I'm also a bit confused about classifiers. What are we doing with multiple ones here? I had (perhaps mistakenly) assumed we're dealing with a single one.

The algorithm also works when being fed an ensemble of probabilistic classifiers, in which case we look at the (weighted) average of the predicted probabilities. This average is then treated in the same manner as the probability that would be outputted by a single classifier. In the same meeting as mentioned above, Hilde suggested we change it to `classifier`, where if the user wants to input an ensemble, a single `sklearn.ensemble` estimator should be provided as input, which our algorithm would then treat in the same way as a single classifier (by calling `classifier.predict_proba`).

> is there a particular reason why the critical region needs to be symmetric? I don't particularly see why it shouldn't be 0.4 and 0.55, for example.

This symmetry makes sense in a binary classification setting, since if there are only 2 labels to choose from, the probability of the chosen label will always be >= 0.5. If we would also allow for multi-class classification, then this symmetry doesn't make sense.

For clarity's sake, let's first look at what the labels would have been without our postprocessing. Without that, the label of any sample will be based on the probability calculated by `classifier`. Let's call this label <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=l"">.

Now, switching to your example, the postprocessing would output each sample as (here I assumed 1 is the desirable label) :

- 1 if sample is from B and probability is <= 0.6
- 0 if sample is from A and probability is <= 0.6
- <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=l""> if sample is from A or B and probability is > 0.6

It would be simpler to just list all the thresholds without the ""privilege"" associations (unless we're discussing something in written text where I don't see such issues).

The only moment I intend to use this terminology is for written text. For specifying the thresholds it is indeed the plan to just list all the thresholds (or maybe provide them in a dict, which would look like {'group' : <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta"">}  ).

If these are the probabilities for getting 1 then with probability 0 it should always be a 0 and with 1 always a 1 and in between it becomes more likely to be a 1 the closer we get to 1. Given that, I'm not sure how it makes sense to assign ""1 if sample is from B and probability is <= 0.6."" The way I understood before was that we want to adjust close to the decision boundary (0.5), so for one group we lower it and for another we increase it, e.g., by 0.1 to have 0.4 and 0.6. Then in that area between 0.4 and 0.6 we'd get different results for the groups.

Right now you're saying you'll accept values from 0 to 1 and then you'll put a threshold on and everything below is 0 and everything above is 1. That's not so different from saying you'll accept any value and you'll put a threshold somewhere with the same outcome, is it? In fact, it's a generalization of what you're proposing. The reason I'm asking is that this is identical to `InterpolatedThresholder` ([see this code](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/blob/main/fairlearn/postprocessing/_interpolated_thresholder.py)) where you pass
```
interpolation_dict[sensitive_feature_value] = Bunch(p0=1, # probability 1, so always choose operation0
                operation0=ThresholdOperation('>', t), # this is the actual threshold
                p1=0, # probability 0 so basically ignore this part

Given the similarities I think the entire API should basically be identical to `InterpolatedThresholder` with the exception of the `interpolation_dict` which should just be a `threshold_dict` that maps sensitive features to their threshold (called `t` above). You'll notice that `fit` is not a no-op, but it trains the estimator unless `prefit=True` is set. That's probably a good pattern to keep for this as well (?).

Now the reason I'm saying that it can be beneficial to accept any real values rather than just those within 0-1 is that you can run any sort of model to approximate scores (your dataset may be about scores, not 0/1 binary values) and then threshold them. It's just a somewhat more general formulation. Nothing stops you from providing just values within 0-1, of course.","2021-09-30 09:45:02","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/958#issuecomment-931154542"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","932217357","From a practical perspective, I have no objections, as it is indeed a more general formulation. The only ""worry"" I have, is that this does not really capture the original intuition of the authors when they introduced RejectOptionClassifier, which is based on looking at the decisions close to the decision boundary. So maybe we should take this into consideration when naming the algorithm, and not name it RejectOptionClassifier, as it deviates from the form in which it was originally proposed?

For the algorithm is doesn't really matter if we fit ourselves or take in a pre-fitted estimator, so I think it is fine to have the same pattern here.

I have a question about the `predict_method` parameter. If I understand correctly, we would want to use `predict` for regressors, and `predict_proba` for classifiers? If this is the case, is it really necessary to let the user input a `predict_method`? Wouldn't it be easier if we just make sure on our side that the correct method gets used?

As long as scikit-learn-conforming binary classifiers with `predict_proba` are used this is good and nice. Beyond that you need customizability. Sadly, not every ML package respects scikit-learn conventions, so this is a rather useful additions that I'd love to see here as well. @MiroDudik @adrinjalali @hildeweerts @riedgar-ms do you have thoughts on this or other parts of the API?","2021-10-01 20:23:58","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/958#issuecomment-932527834"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","933892945","One question: Is the current proposal just to implement a deterministic version of `InterpolatedThresholder` or is it to implement something closer to the Reject Option Classifier in the paper?

The issue is that the Reject Option Classifier in the paper only works with binary / binarized sensitive features, and uses symmetric thresholds of the form 1/2-delta and 1/2+delta. That structure has some advantages and disadvantages:
* the rule is based on easy-to-explain intuition, it's easy to interpret, and it is easy to construct a trade-off curve
* while the rule can be explained easily, the choice of symmetric thresholds is a bit ad-hoc even in binary settings and it's not clear how to generalize the rule beyond binarized sensitive features

My sense is that `ThresholdOptimizer` addresses the disadvantages in the second bullet, but the nice features of the first bullet are lost. A deterministic version of `InterpolatedThresholder` helps with interpretability, but it's still not clear how we should fit those thresholds and/or explore the trade-offs, so there is something to be said for just implementing the binarized version from the paper.

In the end, I'm fine with either of the two approaches.

Re. naming, if we go for deterministic version of `InterpolatedThresholder`, then I like @romanlutz's suggestion `Thresholder`, which would be basically just a specialized constructor for `InterpolatedThresholder`. For the original algorithm, `RejectOptionThresholder` could be basically just a specialized constructor for `Thresholder`.","2021-10-04 22:07:53","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/958#issuecomment-933892945"

Just to see if I understand correctly: the idea of the deterministic `Thresholder` is to set a different (but deterministic) threshold for each sensitive group, right? I think this is a strategy that is commonly discussed (and scrutinized from legal perspective, lol) but not really implemented anywhere, so it would make sense to me to include in Fairlearn.

First of all, I would create separate issues for the various algorithms once you've decided which to implement. Starting from the metrics sounds like a very reasonable approach to me. For example, you could already evaluate standard (fairness-unaware) PCA that way!

#### Dependencies
If there are already implementations that exist for these algorithms I'd suggest checking their dependencies. We wouldn't want to introduce something heavyweight to Fairlearn. However, it might be fine as a soft dependency. I'm particularly thinking of packages to solve these optimization problems. Just something to keep in mind while you're working on this.

#### Metrics
In terms of measures I can think of the following (definitely not exhaustive):
- overall reconstruction error
- overall reconstruction loss of fair PCA compared to fairness-unaware PCA
- sensitive feature group-specific reconstruction error
- sensitive feature group-specific reconstruction loss of fair PCA compared to fairness-unaware PCA (for this latter one we'd have to decide whether to compare with PCA on just that group or PCA on the whole dataset, or alternatively do both)
- The most important metrics IMO are outcome based. It still surprises me that these papers usually don't run e2e analyses where they evaluate how using the method (or not) affects the outcomes per group as measured by typical performance metrics (grouped and ungrouped) as well as other potentially useful metrics (e.g., runtime). Perhaps that has something to do with paper length restrictions. In any case, these are all already available! We'd only have to set up an example to evaluate this end-to-end.
- any others mentioned in these papers?

#### Naming
I actually dislike the term ""Fair PCA"" a bit since it sort of implies that it is (or the results are) fair. As we've described in many places fairness is a sociotechnical concept, so the outcomes may be anything but fair. I can see why the considerations for a paper are somewhat different than for a project like Fairlearn, so perhaps it's time to rethink this before we add it to the package.
Some ideas:
- `FairnessAwarePCA`
- `GroupFairnessAwarePCA`
- `ReconstructionLossMinimizingPCA` (that's a mouthful...)
- something specific to the approach
- using author names (I personally dislike this since we'd be doing this for some techniques and not others; plus, we already cite the papers in the API reference and user guide, of course)","2021-09-14 16:32:02","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/956#issuecomment-919316549"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","920779667","Apologies for the amount of text below. I want to give as much information about the fairness measures to allow for a better discussion about them. 

All three papers below try to solve multi objective optimization problems. They try to minimize the overall reconstruction error while simultaneously maximizing a fairness metric.

For the fairness measures of the optimization problem, I was thinking about the ones proposed in the papers. They are the following:

The goal of the first two papers is to have the additional error compared to the optimal group-specific solution be equal for each group. For example, the additional error your dimensionality reduction algorithm imposes on females compared to the optimal solution for females should be equal to the additional error for males. Note that since the additional error compared to the optimal solution is used, it does not necessarily mean that females and males are equally well represented in the embedded space. The optimal solution for females could be much worse than for males.

**[Fair PCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00103)**:
Image below describes the fairness measure very well.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38749496/133588432-a32b9350-a0e4-47f7-97f9-9406879da756.png)

**[Efficient Fair PCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04931)**:
This method uses almost the same fairness measure, however, since optimal solutions do not always assign the same loss to each group, which is especially a problem when sensitive features have multiple groups, they add additional objectives to the multi objective loss function. In particular, they add the difference between the previously mentioned additional group-specific errors for each combination of groups (called pairwise disparity error). This ensures that the solution tries to minimize all pairwise disparity errors at the same time and addresses the aforementioned issue.

 **[Multi Objective approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06137)**:
This method simply tries to minimize the difference in reconstruction error of each group compared to each other group. This thus does not take into account that the optimal solution for one group might be very different than another group.

Currently, I am debating which of the three makes the most sense. 

Compared to the first fairness measure (paper 1) the second fairness measure (paper 2) is, in my opinion, better than the first one since it is designed to alleviate the issue of the first paper. 

The fairness measure of the third paper does not take into account that the optimal solution for each group might have a vastly different reconstruction error. This can be ""problematic"". Let's say the optimal reconstruction error for females is ten times as high as males. If your desired solution measures fairness in the way paper 3 does it might not improve the reconstruction error for males since it only cares about the difference between the two. Improving the reconstruction error for males even though the female reconstruction error is higher, yet optimal for that group, would decrease the fairness. This results in an overall reconstruction error which is worse. 

The ""problem"" with the fairness metric in paper 3 is thus that the way fairness is measured might cause the algorithm to not improve on overall reconstruction error because the fairness measure gets worse, even though the optimal reconstruction error for a certain group is already met. The fairness metric in paper 2 does not have this ""problem"" since it takes into account the additional reconstruction error compared to the optimal group-specific reconstruction error. I am, however, doubting how fair a solution is which has a very low reconstruction error for males compared to females even though the optimal reconstruction error for females is much lower than males. Paper 2 would call it a fair solution since the additional errors might be very low, however, the reconstruction errors between groups still differ greatly. I doubt whether this would result in a fair decomposition. It seems to me that in this case, it is impossible to do PCA in a fair way since males will be much better represented than females regardless.

What are your thoughts on the advantages/disadvantages between these fairness measures? Do you agree with the problems sketched in the above paragraph or do you think I am missing something?

Maybe a nice alternative would be to implement both fairness measures and allow the user to choose. Of course, I would evaluate both of them and add my findings in the documentation. Do you agree this is the way to go? ","2021-09-16 10:26:58","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/956#issuecomment-920779667"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","920941946","@Thomasq99: Can you spell out more precisely different objectives / fairness measures? It would be good if you presented them in the form that makes it clear how to evaluate them with more than two groups (unless the generalization to multiple groups is obvious). Feel free to just copy-paste the relevant snippets from the papers.

As things stand, fairlearn supports both worst-case performance metrics called `*_group_min()` and `*_group_max()` for the smallest/largest metric value across slices of data corresponding to different group, as well as the disparity metrics called `*_difference` for the largest (pairwise) difference and `*_ratio` for the smallest (pairwise) ratio (see [[here]](https://fairlearn.org/v0.7.0/user_guide/assessment.html#scalar-results-from-metricframe)).

In the absence of more information (what are the downstream harms caused by PCA?), the goals of generic preprocessing seem to fall into the [quality-of-service setting](https://fairlearn.org/v0.7.0/user_guide/fairness_in_machine_learning.html#types-of-harms), for which worst-case performance fairness metrics are more appropriate, so my hunch would be to start with the ""Fair PCA"" algorithm, but like @romanlutz said, we may want to rename it to be more descriptive of the kind of fairness it seeks to enforce. The idea is quite close to what we call [bounded group loss](https://fairlearn.org/v0.7.0/user_guide/mitigation.html#bounded-group-loss), but in ""Fair PCA"" it is presented as an objective, whereas in our reductions it appears as a constraint. We could possibly call it ""MinMaxPCA"" since it minimizes the worst-case reconstruction error among low-rank matrices?

By the way, we already have a preprocessing technique that is being applied to matrices and uses reconstruction error as the underlying metric, so you may want to use it for an inspiration for what the API might look like: [CorrelationRemover](https://fairlearn.org/v0.7.0/api_reference/fairlearn.preprocessing.html).

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","921043049","FWIW I am always in favor of providing as many metrics as possible, explaining their benefits and drawbacks (e.g., through a user guide or example), and then letting users choose which ones they care about. IMO the downstream harms are the most important, so we should really be looking at the fairness metrics for the whole system (not just the preprocessing step). Having a few specific ones for preprocessing doesn't hurt, of course, but we shouldn't get into the habit of thinking that it's sufficient to minimize the max reconstruction error of all groups (to mention one particular metric).

I'd definitely consider creating a very small example (you can check the existing ones in case one of those suits you) where you apply ""normal"" PCA, `CorrelationRemover`, and then subsequently the other techniques as you add them. Then you can measure these new metrics as well as the downstream effects on fairness metrics.

From the discussion above, it seems to me that a fairness metric tailored towards PCA could consider the reconstruction error across groups (but please correct me if I'm wrong). However, I fully agree with @romanlutz and @MiroDudik that downstream model performance should be leading in assessing fairness (and should be included in the user guide section for fairness-aware PCA). This also makes me think that the problems described with the ""optimal"" reconstruction error may not be *super* relevant, as it's the final model performance that we care about the most - but let me know if anybody disagrees!

What is your own view on these metrics, i.e., which one do you think would most useful for Fairlearn users?

I least like rRD, since it only works if the protected group is the minority group, and I'm not sure what the benefits are for this particular metric. rND and rKL, have quite similar results, but rKL is more smooth. So I would prefer rKL, but rND is simpler and easier to understand. I also like the exposure metric, since for me it is very intuitive (counting the position biases and compare the average position bias of each class)

Yes, I think that logarithmic base 2 discount is standard for measuring position bias. I have seen it in multiple papers and not seen any other discounts used, but using other discounts is definitely possible, and I think that the results can indeed be very different.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","891658275","I've been playing around a bit with this in a test repo: https://github.com/hildeweerts/testcitation/blob/main/CITATION.cff.

There was a minor issue with missing quotation marks in the article title. But the main issue with the current file seems to be that it is required to have authors and a version. It turns out that it doesn't actually allow you to directly cite the references; only the metadata provided in the 'main' part of the citation file:

<img width=""340"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24417440/127983618-36afebc3-426a-4411-81b5-13689ae7df3c.png"">

Despite requiring the 'version', the rendering is a bit inconsistent; in APA you get the version, but in BibTex not. This is not entirely unsurprising as `misc` doesn't have a `version` field, but even manually adding a `note=""version 0.7.0""` field doesn't show in the BibTex on GitHub:

APA: 
````
Lisa M., Bot H. (2021). Fairlearn (version 0.7.0).
````

BibTex: 
```@misc{Lisa_Fairlearn_2021,
author = {Lisa, Mona and Bot, Hew},
month = {7},
title = {Fairlearn},
url = {https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn},
year = {2021}
}
```

Although I'm not a fan of the inconsistency, I do think it makes some sense to cite the package rather than the paper, given that the current version of Fairlearn is substantially different from the version for which the white paper was written. But I'm not sure who should be included as 'authors' of the package in that case.","2021-08-03 08:45:09","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/924#issuecomment-891658275"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","892107009","Oooh that's a tough one! I definitely agree that that would be a preferable state, although I have never seen it done anywhere before. scikit-learn, for example, has two papers that they ask you to cite https://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html#citing-scikit-learn. 

That said, we are a project that's focusing on educational materials, so I could see how we could make the case that our website/educational materials are the thing to cite. In that case I would perhaps suggest the following innovative option:
- each release of the package is a new version of the docs and thereby provides a nice snapshot (similar to ArXiv where you have v1, v2, etc.)
- Whenever we do a release we update the list of people who contributed to the docs (so if you cite v0.7.0 the authors are a subset of v0.8.0, for example). The problem is we'd need to get a starting set and I'm a little uncomfortable adding folks that don't consent explicitly (perhaps AUTHORS.md is a good starting point?). One could be more restrictive and say that only a certain set of changes counts, but then one would have to define where exactly the cutoff is and it's really not all that inclusive IMO. This will blow up over time, though, but then if anyone wants to cite this as anything other than <first author> et al. that's really their problem. Ordering is another question, but I suppose simply appending makes sense (?)

Alternatively, we can write a new paper. Who's got time? 🤣 

I think I made the mistake of using `references` rather than the ""first-level"" attributes. Thanks for playing around with this to show how to do it properly 🙂 ","2021-08-03 19:30:02","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/924#issuecomment-892107009"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","892482931","Although I really like your idea in terms of inclusivity, intuitively it doesn't feel right to me that something like a typo fix would get equal attribution to somebody who wrote an entire section in the user guide. But like you already said, it's very tricky to decide ""what's enough"". We could be very rigorous and only add maintainers plus maybe a few other people. On a more practical note, many people are very sloppy with citations and will simply cite whatever they find first, so I doubt that they will carefully select the one for the version they are using, resulting in messy attribution after all...

At some point we should definitely write a new paper, but I'd probably wait until we have decided upon what the educational materials will (roughly) look like. We could of course already get started with writing parts about e.g., the reasoning behind `MetricFrame` API (there will still be a similar ""problem"" of authorship though).

Regardless of authorship, if we're going to use the citation.cff file I think we need to figure out a way to render the version in BibTex (although the date might already give a hint on the version?)","2021-08-04 08:49:33","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/924#issuecomment-892482931"

I do see the benefit in what @adrinjalali suggested, since it's not actually guaranteed that the latest working version of a package supports both Python 3.6 AND Python 3.9 (if they've already moved on to 3.7). We could have a python version-specific set of requirements, but that's not ideal either and doesn't gel well with PyPI which only takes one package upload (rather than n for n different Python versions).

So in conclusion I am in support of @adrinjalali's proposal of pinning the requirements-fixed build to the oldest python version we support (currently 3.6), even if the package versions used there may not even exist in the latest version we support (currently 3.9).","2021-07-29 16:21:51","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/915#issuecomment-889285804"

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","1011094259","I've delved a bit deeper into the issue now. Starting with a list of algorithms to update (as @adrinjalali mentioned):
- [ ] threshold optimizer
- [ ] exponentiated gradient
- [ ] grid search

Then, my thoughts so far... My initial thought was that we could just translate strings to numbers in the shared input validation and be done with it. But I now think that this does not work, because we need to persist this encoding throughout calls to fit & predict. 
I assume we should follow [this sklearn guideline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html#specific-models) which tells us that we should store a list of classes in `self.classes_` on every estimator. This is kind of similar to what @adrinjalali suggests with `pos_label`, but different, so I guess we additionally need to add `pos_label` to the binary predictors.

Side notes: 
1) preferrably, I'd avoid writing the same piece of code to do this in every algorithm, but then I see that sklearn actually does repeat the initialization of `self.classes_` at times, instead of capturing this in some mixin or base class. I'd rather follow sklearn here then, but I wonder why sklearn made this decision (@adrinjalali maybe you know?)
2)  In `interpolated_thresholder.py` line 141 there is `enforce_binary_labels = False` while in `threshold_optimizer.py` line 288 there is `enforce_binary_labels = True`. I can not infer whether threshold optimizer only works on binary data (I think so after reading the docstring).

If I understood properly, this reduction method for regression is a post-processing method while in classification (using GridSearch), we can mitigate within the training process. So, we do not support a similar thing in regression? That was my feature request.
Also in bounded group loss example of your link, we have  :
bgl = BoundedGroupLoss(ZeroOneLoss(), upper_bound=0.1)

ZeroOneLoss is defining the min_val to be 0 and max_val to be 1. Then the question is what is upper bound ?

> If I understood properly, this reduction method for regression is a post-processing method while in classification (using GridSearch), we can mitigate within the training process. So, we do not support a similar thing in regression? That was my feature request.

The reductions approach does not work as a post-processing algorithm for an existing machine learning model but more like a 'wrapper' over a learning algorithm.
An example of how we can use `GridSearch` can be found [here](https://fairlearn.org/v0.7.0/auto_examples/plot_grid_search_census.html#mitigation-with-gridsearch). In the regression scenario, you can replace the `DemographicParity` constraint with `BoundedGroupLoss` (please correct me if I'm wrong about this @MiroDudik @romanlutz @riedgar-ms).


> Also in bounded group loss example of your link, we have  :
bgl = BoundedGroupLoss(ZeroOneLoss(), upper_bound=0.1)

I think the Note below the example answers your question regarding the upperbound: *""In the example above the BoundedGroupLoss object does not use the upper_bound argument. It is only used by reductions techniques during the unfairness mitigation. As a result the constraint violation detected by gamma is identical to the mean absolute error.""*

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","895726453","Hi @alliesaizan ! Thanks for taking a look at this! Nobody else is currently investigating these.

You can try this out by following the steps in this guide: https://fairlearn.org/main/contributor_guide/contributing_documentation.html
The ""simple"" doc build using `python -m sphinx -v -b html -n -j auto docs docs/_build/html` or `make doc` should be sufficient, since the ""full"" doc build doesn't provide the same output verbosity.

The majority of remaining errors seem to be of the following kind:
```
\fairlearn\datasets\__init__.py:docstring of fairlearn.datasets._fetch_adult.fetch_adult:: WARNING: py:class reference target not found: default=True
\fairlearn\datasets\__init__.py:docstring of fairlearn.datasets._fetch_adult.fetch_adult:: WARNING: py:class reference target not found: default=None
\fairlearn\datasets\__init__.py:docstring of fairlearn.datasets._fetch_adult.fetch_adult:: WARNING: py:class reference target not found: default=False
\fairlearn\datasets\__init__.py:docstring of fairlearn.datasets._fetch_adult.fetch_adult:: WARNING: py:class reference target not found: default=False
```
meaning our docstrings have types that aren't recognized. This isn't entirely surprising since we sometimes use free text to describe the types rather than actual type names. The corresponding lines would be: 
- https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/blob/3211828d6a89d0a243c996b23bf06d032446cba7/fairlearn/datasets/_fetch_adult.py#L30

... and a few dozen others. I don't think these are really worth fixing since there's no solution that I'm aware of ( @fairlearn/fairlearn-maintainers  please correct me if I'm wrong!). I haven't checked every single one, though, so there may very well be a few that are fixable.

Other errors that should show when you run the doc build command include:
- > Output from C:\Users\rolutz\git\fairlearn\examples\plot_quickstart.py          y
C:\Users\rolutz\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\pandas\plotting\_matplotlib\core.py:1616: MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: normalize=None does not normalize if the sum is less than 1 but this behavior is deprecated since 3.3 until two minor releases later. After the deprecation period the default value will be normalize=True. To prevent normalization pass normalize=False
 
  I'm not entirely sure what this affects, but you can try passing it and see if it changes anything compared to the [existing quickstart](https://fairlearn.org/v0.7.0/quickstart.html). Ideally the plots should remain the same (unless you can improve them in some way, of course).
- > fairlearn\postprocessing\_interpolated_thresholder.py:115: UserWarning: The value of `prefit` is `True`, but `check_is_fitted` raised `NotFittedError` on the base estimator.
  
  This is actually a warning we're creating from Fairlearn and not yet resolvable (waiting on a fix in scikit-learn).

  shows up a lot in [this example](https://fairlearn.org/main/auto_examples/plot_new_metrics.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-plot-new-metrics-py). Would be good to figure out how we can fix that. It's just a contrived example to show the functionality of Fairlearn's metrics capabilities, so we can certainly change the data if it really has ""no true nor predicted samples"" in some cases, or change the `zero_division` param. Again, haven't looked into it so there may be multiple good options. Suggestions are welcome! ( @riedgar-ms FYI since you wrote that example originally)

 And the culprit appears to be line 234 in the *examples >> plot_new_metrics.py* file, `fbeta_06 = functools.partial(skm.fbeta_score, beta=0.6)`.

> Output from C:\Users\rolutz\git\fairlearn\examples\plot_quickstart.py y

After the deprecation period the default value will be normalize=True. To prevent normalization pass normalize=False

It appears to be caused by the following code chunk:
> metric_frame.by_group.plot(
    kind=""pie"",
    subplots=True,
    layout=[3, 3],
    legend=False,
    figsize=[12, 8],
    title=""Show all metrics in pie"",
)

The pie chart in `plot_quickstart.py` looks like this: 
![output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15962391/130530150-204fd820-c280-44d9-be29-25dc5722f501.png)

For a MetricFrame with the following values:

I get that the idea is to show users how to show how the metrics compare across subgroups, but I am not sure the pie chart achieves this goal. The values across Male and Female don't add up to 1 in most cases, so I don't think this is the correct use of a pie chart. Here's what the pie chart looks like when I pass a `normalize=True` parameter to the plot function:
![temp2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15962391/130530683-4ee48bb6-c48e-497b-8248-6ad1fb2ef0b3.png)

In the charts above, each gender's metric is scaled so that the sum across equals 1 (if the metrics are less than zero), so it's showing the share of the metric distributed across genders. Personally, I'd recommend removing the pie charts because I don't think either explanation is accurate to what the quickstart is trying to show, but adding that parameter gets rid of the warning. I am not sure if there's a better fix. Please let me know what you think!

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","904202749","Thanks for the thorough assessment @alliesaizan !
The filename is a bit of a misnomer since it was originally built for the quickstart, but it's used in other places, too. If you check the webpage's quickstart, you'll find that the pie charts don't show up for the same reasons you describe. To my knowledge, they're only used in the user guide: https://fairlearn.org/main/user_guide/assessment.html#customize-plots-kind
The point there is to show that one can customize the `kind` parameter. I agree that these metrics don't lend themselves to this representation, perhaps with the exception of `count`.

- I think the `lightgbm` tests shouldn't exist in the `test` directory since we have `test_othermlpackages` for that.

I would still like to have the tests that run these scenarios, but perhaps with something ""cheaper"" (faster to train).
- We shouldn't use real datasets as much as we do at the moment.

I think if we are moving away from Gitter to Discord, we should consider de-emphasizing Gitter throughout our experience or even replacing. Another option on the community page is to have the two chat platforms in a 2-column layout side by side instead of stacked so users can compare conversations, making a possible engagement decision easier.

For Gitter I recall us not being sure if we wanted to feature the most active conversations, but there was a worry about curation and how to prioritize since there could be many great conversations happening in tandem — similar may be true for Discord. It would probably be the fairest to have this be a ""most recent"" feed similar to Twitter.

IMHO having just Twitter is okay, this allows us to elevate some portion of social. We could even include a lead in paragraph that highlights meetings and events announced through the Twitter account. Alternatively this could be it’s own module.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","848426005","I've encountered the same thing with the chest x-ray classification case study and my workaround was to always calculate:

- metrics of interest

- number of positives
- percentage of positives

You can do the same for error rate! 

- number of errors
- percentage of errors / error rate

They should appear next to each other in the `by_group` table and you can interpret it much easier.

Reducing it to the lowest common denominator may be more of a challenge, but I honestly don't quite see the point in doing that. For all numbers we should have a way of formatting the number output if someone doesn't like `5E-5`, for example.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","847653368","Model-agnostic post-hoc explanation methods (including LIME and model agnostic SHAP) perturb instances in a particular way and then see how this changes the predictions of the model. AFAIK most implementations require a `predict()` function that takes as input instances `X` as some array-like object. `ThresholdOptimizer` requires the user to pass `sensitive_features` at prediction time as well, which I expect the problems to arise from. I don't think the current implementations - at least of `shap` and `lime` - support passing additional arguments to the explainer. There might be a way to solve this through wrapping the functions etc. in some smart way, but it depends a bit on how the explainers try to access `X`. This could be quite tricky...

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","857328005","As @hildeweerts explained above there's no way around providing sensitive features for `ThresholdOptimizer`. I would go a step further and say that you shouldn't use it for any real-world application since it's mostly just a benchmark of how much you have to give up in terms of performance to reach parity in terms of a chosen metric across groups. That comes with a few quirks such as applying randomness to outputs. 

What does explaining a random output even mean? Let's take a model with 10% random outputs, 40% depends on the rule `>0.3` and 50% on `>0.7`. Looking inside this model I can tell you that by sheer chance any sample regardless of features can get 0 or 1. If you try it 100 times you'll see how the results will vary and include both 0s and 1s (well, they probably will).
You don't need an explainer here, because you already know exactly how you get to the output. If you have a score less than 0.3 then you have a 10% chance of getting 1, if your score is >0.3 and <0.7 then you have a 50% chance, and if it's >0.7 then you are guaranteed to get a score of 1. Note that some groups will probably not have the baseline 10%. The PR #614 explains this quite nicely I think, but it requires a little more work to get merged, so you won't find that content in the docs yet.
I would always suggest derandomizing these thresholds as much as possible if you're actually considering using something like this. There's also the issue that it's quite obvious that you're using different thresholds per group, so depending on the laws governing your application domain this may be illegal (even though it may improve disparity metrics). I'll also note that fairness is sociotechnical, so there is no one-size-fits-all solution to fairness that can always be expressed through mathematical definitions.

Applying a post-hoc explainer will mislead here since it'll try and figure out how this solution was reached based on random outputs. Instead, the more interesting part would be to explain where your scores came from, since everything after that is quite interpretable as is.

Taking another step back, similar points apply to `fairlearn.reductions.ExponentiatedGradient` since it's also probabilistic. `GridSearch` should be just fine because it decides on a single predictor internally rather than probabilistically choosing one of many. Additionally, neither of the reductions techniques require `sensitive_features` at `predict` time.

I don't quite understand your concern about `GridSearch` in the notebook. This is your code:
```
sweep = GridSearch(RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=30, random_state=0),
                   constraints=DemographicParity(),
                   grid_size=71)
sweep.fit(X_train, y_train,
          sensitive_features=x_gender)
```
Later you use existing code to calculate non-dominated models, but comment it out to just get all models generated from the grid, and you take the first one of those to create predictions:
```
y_pred_mitigated=non_dominated[0].predict(X_test)
```
which raises the question: why the first one? It's very likely not the best model you can choose. If you want the default choice just go with the `sweep` object and call `predict` on it. All this extra code looks like it's been copied from a notebook of ours and is mainly there to allow plotting to illustrate the fairness-accuracy trade-off, but since you're not doing that I don't see why you'd choose that model manually (as model 0). It's always recommended to factor in that trade-off (potentially in more than 2 dimensions) when choosing a model.

Later you write
> Now trying eli5 on model selected by gridsearch it works fine for explanation but model is not perfect as we have seen selection rate above.
That is probably related to choosing model 0 rather than one with a better trade-off. You can always plot the selection rate vs. another metric for all the predictors internal to grid search if you want to use that as a criterion for selecting a model.

All in all, the models resulting from `GridSearch` should work with post-hoc explainers.","2021-06-09 02:44:09","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/818#issuecomment-857328005"

In any case, the code-block shouldn't include all the code that would go into an example, but rather the important lines only (should be no more than a handful or so). I believe your current example only uses Fairlearn in assessment, but not yet for mitigation. Assessment isn't really different for tensorflow models since it's just about the predictions/output, so I don't think we'd need to mention tensorflow in any way there. For mitigation we (might) need to plug that model into one of Fairlearn's mitigation techniques, so that's somewhat different. 

Out of curiosity I check the pytorch tutorials and it turns out they have an entirely separate repository for the tutorial build. I haven't quite figured out how they merge the generated docs with the generated docs from the basic doc build (for API reference etc.), but that would be another option (although much more involved, of course). I think we can keep this in mind for the future, although it's not really viable for this issue right now.","2021-06-27 06:57:27","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/814#issuecomment-869112836"

Specifying the objective in the API makes sense to me since we do that in postprocessing. We only use strings there, but that has its own limitations. For example, I can't plug in F1 score even though there's no particularly good reason why I shouldn't. If it's a Moment I can write one custom for my case.

Then the question is whether we should be existing the existing `ErrorRate` moment or creating a new moment with this functionality and if so what should be the name of the new moment and the mechanism of providing different costs. Some possibilities:

```python
# should we extend ErrorRate?
objective = ErrorRate(costs={'fn': 1.0, 'fp': 0.1}) 

# or create a new moment?
objective = CostSensitiveLoss(costs={'fn': 1.0, 'fp': 0.1})

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","843848874","Hi @vamsidesu5 - I think [section 2.1 of our user guide](https://fairlearn.org/v0.6.2/user_guide/assessment.html#metrics) and the [API Reference of MetricFrame](https://fairlearn.org/v0.6.2/api_reference/fairlearn.metrics.html) would be good places to get started.

Here's a small code example to show what the issue is:

```python
from fairlearn.metrics import MetricFrame
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

y_true = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
y_pred = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
sensitive_features = [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]

mf = MetricFrame(metric= { 'accuracy_score' : accuracy_score, 'confusion matrix' : confusion_matrix},
            y_true = y_true,
            y_pred = y_pred,
            sensitive_features = sensitive_features)
```

Now, if we print the results in `mf.by_group` that works perfectly fine:

```python
                    accuracy_score  confusion matrix
sensitive_feature_0                                 
0                              0.5  [[1, 1], [1, 1]]
1                                1  [[2, 0], [0, 2]]
```

However, if we do `mf.difference()`, which computes the difference of each metric between the two groups, pandas raises `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. The reason is that the 'confusion matrix' column of `mf.by_group` contains arrays instead of floats. This error is expected, but not a good user experience. In particular, it would have been possible to compute difference for `accuracy_score` if we hadn't put in the confusion matrix as well:

```python
mf = MetricFrame(metric= { 'accuracy_score' : accuracy_score},
            y_true = y_true,
            y_pred = y_pred,
            sensitive_features = sensitive_features)

mf.difference()
```

which simply outputs:

```
accuracy_score    0.5
dtype: float64
```

I hope this makes things a bit clearer. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. Also, if you feel like the user guide is unclear in any way, please raise an issue as well - all feedback is super valuable :)","2021-05-19 08:00:24","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/800#issuecomment-843848874"

I think it would make sense to return the value for the ones that are scalar and `NaN` for those that aren't, potentially with a warning message that says something like ""Some of the metrics are not scalar and `NaN` is returned"". Or we could even add an argument which controls how to handle such errors, I've seen a similar `errors` argument in pandas (e.g., [`pd.to_numeric`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.to_numeric.html)), where you can choose to `'raise'`, `'coerce'`,  or`'ignore'` invalid values.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","838024506","I like the idea of having a tool that helps people think about sample sizes. However, I am always a bit cautious with recommending statistical tests for other purposes than statistical testing in a scientific study. The results can become misleading if the tools aren't used properly. So I'd like to make sure that we write proper documentation for this function.

For example, if you compute the sample sizes for multiple sensitive features, you'd need to correct alpha to account for multiple testing (i.e., in addition to the correction that's inherent in the post-hoc ANOVA itself). I also believe that a power analysis is supposed to be computed based on the theoretical effect size of interest, rather than the observed effect size (see e.g., [this blog](http://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2014/12/observed-power-and-what-to-do-if-your.html)). In our scenario, I *think* that means that you need to define the difference in proportions you would deem relevant (which is a hard context-dependent question, but one you need to answer anyways).

I agree with @adrinjalali that in some cases the usage of ""bias"" or ""de-bias"" might be appropriate, but I wouldn't say that's the case for this specific paper. In particular, there is no exact specification of the type of ""bias"" that is ""removed"" and where it is supposed to originate from. Instead, like most fairness mitigation approaches, the method optimizes for a particular fairness metrics, foregoing the biases from which potential unfairness may have originated. 

My first thought was also to go for something like ""AdversarialFairness"" - although that also still sounds a bit absolute and that it's related to fairness is probably clear from the fact that it's part of Fairlearn. ""AdversarialMitigation"" could be an option.

But I also share @adrinjalali 's concern in terms of the discoverability of the approach...

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","930281635","Hi there, I have some questions regarding this implementation. The paper leaves room for quite some freedom, and we need to make some tough decision choices regarding this. Most notably, I can think of situations in which one may want to change:
- Predictor/adversarial models (make predictor very complex, possibly)
- Output layer. Continuous vs discrete (and for discrete with demographic parity, single binary->sigmoid vs multiclass->cross entropy is another choice). Loss functions depend on this.
- Which metric. The paper speaks about DP, Equality of odds, Equality of opportunity, but they require slightly different scenarios (Equality of odds requires adversary has more inputs and binary values, whereas Equality of opportunity requires predictions are discrete)

One possible implementation is to provide the required code that one would put in a training loop, but not more. Then, a user of this module has to implement their own training loop. Pros: lots of freedom, can do validation at every step, batching how the user would like. Cons: users will have to know precisely what parameters are possible, and must understand the original paper or this function really well.

Another possibility, what I see in AIF360 (among others) also, is to provide the training loop and most choices given above as standard. Pros: Simpler use, maybe we can even use the standard `.fit(X,y)` and `.predict(X)` as the user needn't care how it is fit (what parameters/training loop.) which fits in well with sklearn-style. We can define the different metrics, the user just has to choose. Cons: no custom training loops, so besides possibly some keyword parameters the user cant add things like validation every X epochs or batching, neither can the user define custom adversary models. We don't know how much to train (but the user can supply epochs or something at least)

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","865256395","We typically accept a variety of input types. See the `fit` method of `ThresholdOptimizer`, for example: https://fairlearn.org/main/api_reference/fairlearn.postprocessing.html#fairlearn.postprocessing.ThresholdOptimizer.fit

After calling `fit` the weights would be stored on the object (let's say in a member called `weights`, so we could either retrieve it using 
```
reweighing_obj = KamiranCaldersReweighing(...)
reweighing_obj.fit(X, y, sensitive_features=sensitive_features)
w = reweighing_obj.weights
```
or perhaps with a method `get_weights()` but it feels odd to write a custom getter like that. @adrinjalali @MiroDudik may have thoughts on this. I checked the scikit-learn docs for conventions but didn't really find anything similar (preprocessing that results in weights). Regardless of how we pass it on to the estimator we use for training we definitely need to create the weights internally and store them on the object.

I imagine all of this would go into the `fairlearn.preprocessing` module.

If I recall correctly the implementation in AIF360 does something similar to what @romanlutz proposes. Quite a few of my students had issues with that, because it wasn't clear to them that they should retrieve the weights and pass them separately to the estimator. I can imagine we could add an (optional?) estimator argument in which case it would be used more like a wrapper than a separate pre-processing module, but I can also see how that could open another can of worms... @adrinjalali do you expect this is something that will be taken up soon from the scikit-learn side? 

### re. naming
I don't like it a ton, but given that fair ml researchers haven't been very productive in coming up with unique names, I do think going with the (first) author makes the most sense.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","833913873","Welcome @wcheung-code ! This is very exciting and I'm glad to see this topic finally approached in Fairlearn.

Regarding the datasets: if you can find them on the internet I don't see a reason why we couldn't add them to the `datasets` module. I'm pretty sure I found some admissions data from UC Berkeley when we last thought about Simpson's paradox. That said, we discussed datasets quite a lot a few months ago and reached the conclusion that one needs to add extensive descriptions, caveats, background information, etc. about the datasets. I suggest you create separate issues for each dataset you intend to add. Then you can add that information into the issue and later into the dataset documentation. At least that's my recommendation.

In general, I recommend breaking your work down as much as possible. For example, describing what counterfactual analysis is could be its own PR, the dataset additions could be their own PRs, and then the notebook, of course. Perhaps you also plan to add functionality to the Fairlearn package (e.g. metrics or algorithms), which could be yet another set of PRs. The smaller the changes the easier it will be to get them merged. As you can see with many of my own PRs its quite hard to review if they're too big and tackle lots of things. At that point we'd need to ask you to break them up into smaller pieces.

In the meanwhile, don't hesitate to reach out with questions on how things work. I don't quite know what you mean with the multi-class question, but perhaps our recent [FAQ](https://fairlearn.org/main/faq.html) addition on the topic helps (search for ""Does Fairlearn support multi-class classification?"").","2021-05-06 22:27:13","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/772#issuecomment-833913873"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","834696076","Thanks for the warm welcome @romanlutz! :)

I agree and am well aligned with breaking down the work into manageable issues. Thanks for letting me know! We can reserve this issue for the documentation phase of my work (which will only use synthetic data). Once I am able to get a first working iteration, I plan to open up new issues regarding dataset choices, and potential areas where I can contribute code to the project. Thanks!

The question about multiclass support was referencing to the paper rather than FairLearn. Specifically, the CMU researchers' analysis is only focused on a few binary classification settings, so extending counterfactual analysis to the multiclass setting is still a question to think about. It's great to know that FairLearn supports multiclass problems; I'm sure I'll be leveraging a lot of those existing capabilities.

Again these questions are more long term focused, so I think it's best to address these questions in separate tickets. 

Thanks again for the welcome and the thoughts!

Ah, thanks for flagging @shimst3r! I should have been more clear in the issue. This is referring to the sub-sections of construct validity from the Measurement and Fairness paper, including:

- face validity
- content validity
  - contestedness

- convergent validity
- discriminant validity

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","832091177","Hi @MartaMarchiori !

One option would be to take a screenshot of the dashboard. Not ideal, I know, but the dashboard is being removed from Fairlearn at the moment #766 in favor of simpler plots. #766 has a few screenshots of what that looks like, although you don't really need to wait for any PRs to get merged since the functionality already exists. With any `MetricFrame` you can simply plot it, e.g.,

```
>>> from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, accuracy_score
>>> from fairlearn.metrics import false_positive_rate, true_positive_rate, selection_rate
>>> metrics = {
...     'accuracy': accuracy_score,
...     'precision': precision_score,
...     'recall': recall_score,
...     'false positive rate': false_positive_rate,
...     'true positive rate': true_positive_rate,
...     'selection rate': selection_rate,
...     'count': lambda y_true, y_pred: y_true.shape[0]}
>>> metric_frame = MetricFrame(metrics, y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features=sex)
>>> metric_frame.by_group.plot.bar(
...     subplots=True, layout=[3,3], legend=False, figsize=[12,8],
...     title='Show all metrics')  # doctest: +SKIP
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10245648/117039565-c642e000-acbd-11eb-9db5-a1f079f4df7e.png)
... and matplotlib plots can be saved easily.

If you are really set on the dashboard, there's a newer version in the [raiwidgets package](https://github.com/microsoft/responsible-ai-widgets). The `_create_group_metric_set` function from Fairlearn can give you all the metrics in a storeable format to pass to the `FairnessDashboard` later on when you want to look at them again. Or you can just use it out of the box with Azure (see [this blog post](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-machine-learning-fairness-aml)) since your metrics are persisted in the cloud there and the dashboard can be viewed anytime in AzureML Studio.

I hope this helps!

I'm leaving this issue open since we should probably put this answer in the Q&A section of our website. 
TODO:
- [ ] Create a Q&A section, something along the lines of: ""What happened to the `FairlearnDashboard`?"" [answer should point to the new repo and to our plotting functionality through `MetricFrame`]

- Ignore the `notebooks` directory. These are only notebooks that existed before we started using `sphinx-gallery`. Eventually they'll either be migrated to the gallery format (basically using `.py` files with the magic markers to separate cells) or deleted.
- Examples/notebooks to render on the webpage are in the `examples` directory. So you can use whatever scikit-learn specifies for notebook directory (which may just be nothing in case they use a default). This should fix the path issue for `plot_quickstart_selection_rate.py`

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","831271204","I agree that this is a super useful addition. I also like @hildeweerts suggestion to consider extending both sklearn's [roc_curve](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_curve.html#sklearn.metrics.roc_curve) and [plot_roc_curve](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.plot_roc_curve.html#sklearn.metrics.plot_roc_curve).

Until we find somebody willing to implement this, can we tease out the API we would like to see? We would use the same pattern for other curves that we discussed and come up in fairness literature like `calibration_curve` and `cdf_curve`.

For plotting, my preference is to have API of the following form:
* `plot_roc_curves(*, y_true, y_score, sensitive_features, **kwargs) -> matplotlib.axes.Axes`

For just getting `fpr`, `tpr`, `thresholds` (but no plotting), we could have
* `roc_curves(*, y_true, y_score, sensitive_features, **kwargs)`
  * I am less sure about the return format here. But one idea would be to return three dictionaries `fpr`, `tpr`, `thresholds` that would be indexed by the sensitive feature values (or a tuple of sensitive feature values if we have multiple sensitive features).
  * Another idea would be to do something similar to threshold optimizer, where we return `tpr` and `threshold` (a generalized notion of threshold) as a function of `fpr`, where the range of `fpr` values would be the same for all sensitive features. This I think is actually a much more useful output format for any further processing.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","831289188","I agree, let's get the conversation started (which may be relevant to the other plotting functionality as well? @romanlutz )

* `plot_roc_curve` 
   * If we want to be consistent with sklearn we should use something like: ```plot_roc_curve(Estimator, X, y, sensitive_features,  *, sample_weight=None, drop_intermediate=True, response_method='auto', name=None, ax=None, pos_label=None, **kwargs)``` returning a `RocCurveDisplay` (or similar). 
   * I would also be okay with using `y_score` directly in the API, as it allows for a bit more flexibility wrt the estimator, although that is at the risk of people accidentally using `y_pred`.
* `roc_curve(y_true, y_score, sensitive_features, *, pos_label=None, sample_weight=None, drop_intermediate=True)`
   * I don't see a need for **kwargs here 
   * I think returning a dictionary makes sense! Could you elaborate a bit on the other idea? I don't fully understand yet what that would look like.

Is there a specific reason you want to put `*` at the beginning?

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","831412475","Re. compatibility with sklearn, I noticed that they use `estimator, X, y` signature, but it seems very limiting (or forcing some workarounds with pass-through estimators). So, in this case, I was proposing to intentionally deviate from the sklearn pattern (that's why I would also use a different name, i.e., `plot_roc_curves`). I would make all of the arguments keyword-only to prevent any confusion with the sklearn format.

Re. `*` at the beginning: I mostly want to ensure keyword-only arguments, because some common libraries have the opposite convention from sklearn around the order of `y_true` vs `y_pred`. I wouldn't mind allowing both `y_pred` and `y_score` (as interchangeable), so the signature could be something like:
* `roc_curve(*, y_true, y_score=None, y_pred=None, sensitive_features, ... )`

- I see you have a dir `metrics` and a dir `postprocessing` which has some plotting functionality in it already.  Where do you want this feature to live? `metrics` or `postprocessing` ? 

- Also this function already exists:  _calculate_tradeoff_points which --at first glance-- does appear to compute ROC points.  Do we need to just extend this to process the data grouped by the sensitive features? 

- If we're plotting the ROC curve for each subgroup, that's just a line plot with traces. It sounds like Fairlearn is moving away from having a dashboard and instead enabling plotting as a set of utilities. Is that right? In which case do we want to build a base `_line_plot` and `_grouped_line_plot` class in Matplotlib or maybe plot.ly (interactive) which would be re-usable? Then inherit that class into other metrics classes that might benefit from plotting?  

- Related: I see this plotting functionality here: https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/blob/main/fairlearn/postprocessing/_plotting.py ... do we want to add to or extend this module?  i.e. build out plotting utilities in the same module?

I would suggest creating a new file for it under the `metrics` folder.

The postprocessing method has a lot of custom code that we can switch out at a later point. For now, I would completely ignore it since it has somewhat more comprehensive requirements. Same for the plotting capabilities of that module, they're very custom to the mitigation technique used there. Let's ignore it for now.

You're right about the dashboard moving away (in fact #766 deletes it), so this should just be its own standlone utility. We're all in favor of reusing things that already exist. Perhaps some of the code snippets from this thread are useful to have ROC plots with multiple lines (one per group)?

I am thinking of testing out using the existing MetricFrame to do the data splitting. The benefit of using MetricFrame is that this would be a standard way of handling splitting the data on sensitive values. You get the 'overall' curve as well as the curves for the sensitive values, and any methods we add to the MetricFrame class would be inherited by the ROC Curve class. The downside is that the `_roc_utils.py` would have a dependency on MetricFrame. Thoughts before I head down this path?

* you could just start with `plot_roc_curves`
* it would be good to figure out the invocation format on this issue (either at the same time as PR or before PR)
* I wouldn't worry about integrating things internally with MetricFrame yet... I expect that we'll need to re-implement and re-factor MetricFrame because it's 10x slower than an equivalent pandas code (I'll create an issue on that hopefully next week), but if it simplifies your life (rather than makes it more complicated), go for it
* One idea re. MetricFrame would be to just use the following ""metric"" (maybe this is what you had in mind?):
```python
def metric(y_true, y_pred):

mf = MetricFrame(metric, y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features=sensitive_features)

I think the best course of action is to build on MetricFrame as it will create a common language across the Fairlearn API. So you can split by group and use the series index to plot a subset of the sensitive feature subgroups (remember is the cartesian product, so selecting a smaller set to plot will be important.)  

TODO: 
- Determine how best to instantiate plot figure, axis (right now there's a bit of redundant code; might instantiate with the class to have a default figure, ax)
- Separate functions to add 'Overall"" and ""Baseline"" traces to enable users to toggle these traces on/off 
- logging, error handling
- Add additional AUC score and related metric functionality by sensitive feature group... if we're generating the AUC score anyway, why not return it 
- unit tests
Overall thoughts on this basic approach.

Fairlearn way, whatever that is...and then call that and instantiate it if
the user does not pass their own fig, ax. I was going to do it as part of
the class.

If it’s in the class and then somebody looks at the code, It should be
clear to them how they can change the defaults to suit their needs by
either passing their own figure or updating parameters of the class
instance. And, for those not familiar with plotting or just needing a
convenience method, the defaults should meet their basic needs.

In the ROC case, we’re taking advantage of scikit to provide default axis
labels, etc. So even less to configure...

Thoughts...

Although, now I'm not sure you actually meant ""styling"" (as in https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/style_sheets/style_sheets_reference.html) or just axis labels, legend, etc.. Regardless, it shouldn't be preconfigured and people should be allowed to configure it however they like.

What they have done is offered the full convenience of a labeled plot. However, those who want to provide their own fig, ax, or overwrite the defaults can. They use the default figure size, font, etc. Notice how they return the figure and the axis as 'self' which enables the user to configure the plot further if they wish. 

I am following the above approach.  In fact, in the case of Roc Curves, I am actually using RocCurveDisplay.  

Because plotting is specific to the metric you are plotting, I think providing labeled plotting functions that add convenience to the relevant modules makes more sense than building a generic shared plotting utility. Basically adapting common metrics to return data by subgroup and the associated plots to handle plotting sensitive features by subgroup.","2021-06-04 18:53:58","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/758#issuecomment-854936577"

Obviously that can be fixed with a couple of nice examples right in the API doc and updating the user guide, but I want to make sure this is on our radar (i.e., no code PR without updating the docs). 

I would also suggest providing a few examples of what that would look like if we have different kinds of metrics (e.g. accuracy needs `y_true` and `y_pred`, selection rate doesn't need a second set of `y`s) in the same set of `metrics` passed in.

Firstly, I think that the idea behind `shared_sample_params` is a good one. Indeed, I considered putting something like that in last autumn when I was writing `MetricFrame`. I didn't because it wasn't a 'must have' feature. However, as I said above, I think it should be a `Dict[str,vector]` and not `**kwargs`. Going with the latter makes it harder for us to add any other named arguments of our own (since whatever name we pick, we're bound to break someone) at a later date. We 'explode' the `Dict` when the metric functions themselves are invoked.

Secondly, I certainly don't think that `MetricFrame` is the last word on these sort of metrics. Indeed, I'm sure that areas like text or vision may well need similar but different functionality (I don't know enough about them to say). But like @hildeweerts , I think that it may well be better to take each by itself, and figure out what works best for that domain, rather than trying to shoehorn them into `MetricFrame`.

I can see the logic in renaming the `metric` argument to `metrics` (it is a potential break, but only if people are naming their arguments). I'm not sure I understand the motivation behind forcing named arguments. I think that would make the interface much less `skearn`-like.","2021-05-03 18:24:17","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/756#issuecomment-831443732"

If the use case is ""we can drop the current parameters, and have a different set of parameters instead"" then we should probably be creating a new class to handle the second set of parameters. Right now, I feel that `MetricFrame` does the fairly simple task of taking an `sklearn`-style `(y_true, y_pred)` metric, and turning it into one with grouping (via the sensitive features). I'd prefer to keep it that way, and work out the best API for a new use case from a clean sheet.

It may be that there is a more general API hiding within, and that we end up changing `MetricFrame` to wrap (or subclass) that. But I think it would still be better to keep the existing `MetricFrame` API around, doing its simple job.","2021-05-04 00:23:23","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/756#issuecomment-831615145"

I was thinking the same! 

I think the majority of users will be looking for classification/regression metrics and may not even be familiar with reinforcement learning. Having to look at examples to understand how to use an API even in the 'simplest' scenario, signals that it is not intuitive.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","841889274","Finally, some examples... in those examples I'm considering two alternative proposals for the API (they slightly differ from the original proposal in my issue at the top):

#### Alternative A: Optional `y_true` / `y_pred` / `sensitive_features`

```python
MetricFrame(*, metrics, y_true=None, y_pred=None, sensitive_features=None, control_features=None, sample_params=None)
```

#### Alternative B: Also allow any keyword arguments and internally use `inspect.signature` to decide who gets what

```python
MetricFrame(*, metrics, y_true=None, y_pred=None, sensitive_features=None, control_features=None,
            sample_params=None, **direct_sample_params)
```
The idea is that `**direct_sample_params` would contain sample parameters and each of them would be passed to all the metrics whose signature includes that parameter name. We retain the nested dictionary `sample_params` as a way to deal with naming conflicts (but there's also a work-around using lambda expressions).

Now the scenarios. I've written them down purely technically, but Scenarios 1 & 2 came up in various notebooks, Scenario 3 is already under a PR, and Scenario 4 comes up in settings with censored data (e.g., many allocation settings).

### Scenario 1: Classification metrics and scoring metrics in the same metric frame

For example, let's say you train a logistic model and would like to evaluate both its classification accuracy as well as the area under the ROC curve.

Say we have:
```python
y_true = # vector of binary classification labels
sf = # vector of sensitive features
y_pred = estimator.predict(X) # binary predictions
y_score = estimator.predict_proba(X)[1] # scores
```

Current approach is something like this:
```python
metrics = {
    `accuracy`: skm.accuracy_score,
    `auc`: lambda y_true, y_pred, y_score: skm.roc_auc_score(y_true, y_score)
}
mf = MetricFrame(metrics, y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features=sf, 
                 sample_params={
                     'auc': {'y_score': y_score}})
```

#### Alternative 1A: Optional `y_true` / `y_pred`

```python
metrics = {
    `accuracy`: skm.accuracy_score,
    `auc`: skm.roc_auc_score
}
mf = MetricFrame(metrics=metrics, y_true=y_true, sensitive_features=sf, 
                 sample_params={
                     'accuracy': {'y_pred': y_pred},
                     'auc': {'y_score': y_score}})
```

#### Alternative 1B: Also allow any keyword arguments and internally use `inspect.signature` to decide who gets what

```python
metrics = {
    `accuracy`: skm.accuracy_score,
    `auc`: skm.roc_auc_score
}
mf = MetricFrame(metrics=metrics, y_true=y_true, y_pred=y_pred, y_score=y_score, sensitive_features=sf)
```

### Scenario 2: Multiple models in the same metric frame

Say we have three models giving predictions `y_pred1`, `y_pred2`, `y_pred3` that we wish to compare. The current approach is something like:
```python
metrics = {
    `model1_accuracy`: skm.accuracy_score,
    `model2_accuracy`: lambda y_true, y_pred, y_pred2: skm.accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred2),
    `model3_accuracy`: lambda y_true, y_pred, y_pred3: skm.accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred3),
}
mf = MetricFrame(metrics, y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features=sf, 
                 sample_params={
                     'model2_accuracy': {'y_pred2': y_pred2},
                     'model3_accuracy': {'y_pred3': y_pred3}})
```

#### Alternative 2A: Optional `y_true` / `y_pred`

```python
metrics = {
    `model1_accuracy`: skm.accuracy_score,
    `model2_accuracy`: skm.accuracy_score,
    `model3_accuracy`: skm.accuracy_score
}
mf = MetricFrame(metrics=metrics, y_true=y_true, sensitive_features=sf, 
                 sample_params={
                     'model1_accuracy': {'y_pred': y_pred1}
                     'model2_accuracy': {'y_pred': y_pred2},
                     'model3_accuracy': {'y_pred': y_pred3}})
```

#### Alternative 2B: Also allow any keyword arguments and internally use `inspect.signature` to decide who gets what

```python
metrics = {
    `model1_accuracy`: lambda y_true, y_pred1: skm.accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred1),
    `model2_accuracy`: lambda y_true, y_pred2: skm.accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred2),
    `model3_accuracy`: lambda y_true, y_pred3: skm.accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred3),
}
mf = MetricFrame(metrics=metrics, y_true=y_true,
                 y_pred1=y_pred1, y_pred2=y_pred2, y_pred3=y_pred3, sensitive_features=sf)
```
(Note that the solution from 2A would still be allowed. I think that 2A is cleaner than 2B.)

### Scenario 3: Streaming metrics

This is the scenario from #670 (and #655). The idea is to support adding data and updating a metric frame in a streaming fashion.

The currently proposed initialization is this:
```python
mf = MetricFrame(skm.recall_score, y_true=[], y_pred=[], sensitive_features=[], streaming=True)
```

#### Alternative 3A: Optional `y_true` / `y_pred` / `sensitive_features`
```python
mf = MetricFrame(skm.recall_score, streaming=True)
```

### Scenario 4: Metrics that don't use `y_true` and `y_pred`

In cost-sensitive learning, the metric parameters would be `y_pred` and `costs` (for each example, providing a vector of costs for predicting each of the classes). In contextual bandits, the metric parameters would be `actions_taken`, `rewards`, `propensities`, `actions_target` (or something like that).

Below, assume that there are metrics defined for the above two settings, say:
```python
cost_sensitive_loss(*, costs, y_pred)  # for cost-sensitive learning
inverse_propensity_score(*, actions_taken, rewards, propensities, actions_target) # for contextual bandits
```

Current approach:
```python
def cost_sensitive_loss_wrapper(y_true, y_pred, *, costs):
    return cost_sensitive_loss(costs=costs, y_pred=y_pred)

def ips_wrapper(y_true, y_pred, *, actions_taken, rewards, propensities, actions_target):
    return inverse_propensity_score(actions_taken=actions_taken, rewards=rewards,
                                    propensities=propensities, actions_target=actions_target)

cost_sensitive_loss_mf = MetricFrame(cons_sensitive_loss_wrapper,
    dummy_y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features=sf,
    sample_params = {'costs': costs})

ips_mf = MetricFrame(ips_wrapper,
    dummy_y_true, dummy_y_pred, sensitive_features=sf,
    sample_params = {'actions_taken': actions_taken, 'rewards': rewards,
                     'propensities': propensities, 'actions_target': actions_target})
```

#### Alternative 4A: Optional `y_true` / `y_pred`

```python
cost_sensitive_loss_mf = MetricFrame(metrics=cost_sensitive_loss,   # wrapper not needed
    y_true=y_true,
    sample_params = {'costs': costs})

ips_mf = MetricFrame(metrics=inverse_propensity_score,
    sample_params = {'actions_taken': actions_taken, 'rewards': rewards,   # wrapper not needed
                     'propensities': propensities, 'actions_target': actions_target})
```

#### Alternative 4B: Also allow any keyword arguments and internally use `inspect.signature` to decide who gets what

```python
cost_sensitive_loss_mf = MetricFrame(metrics=cost_sensitive_loss,
    y_true=y_true,
    costs=costs)

ips_mf = MetricFrame(metrics=inverse_propensity_score,
    actions_taken=actions_taken, rewards=rewards,
    propensities=propensities, actions_target=actions_target)
```

I still feel that we should leave `MetricFrame` largely as-is (with the exception of converting to keyword-only arguments.... note that this does _not_ involve making `y_true` and `y_pred` optional in the above proposal, since there is not a transition API which accepts the positional arguments with a warning). It does a fairly simple thing well, so keep it that way.

The _argument_ is obviously called `y_true` but its type is certainly not required to be `int`.

@hildeweerts  that sort of leads to the question ""Then what is `y` as opposed to `y_true` and `y_pred`?"". Scanning through the link to `sklearn` it appears that it's used for cases where the ground truth isn't known?

I'm not sure if I understand your question correctly so sorry in advance if this is all obvious to you. But generally `y` is used for ground-truth during training, my guess is that the authors decided to not call it `y_true` here because there is no explicit counterpart `y_pred`. For evaluation we need to be more specific, hence `y_true` and `y_pred` (or `y_score`). Similarly, they use `labels` to refer to cluster labels and only append `_true` and `_pred` in cases where there is an explicit ground-truth.

To make things more confusing for you generally speaking `y`/`y_true` are interchangeable and `labels`/`labels_pred`. The reason for this is that by default clustering problems don't really have a ""ground truth"" (otherwise we would probably be better off doing classification).

Yes. It's a nomenclature issue. When I see `y_pred`  I think it's the predicted labels. In fact, MetricFrame also allows you to pass other things in its place. Yes, it works. It's just not clear for the user. 

And, in fact, all I needed to do was split the data by sensitive feature.  I strongly feel like that should be a class/module on its own. Then you can use it in combination or with custom classes to compute metrics. 

I totally agree with @riedgar-ms but would frame it a little differently: 

> We've got two things going on here:

> * Where we have a precomputed metric where we just need to slice it up by the sensitive features
> * Where there are multiple 'columns' in `y_pred` and/or `y_true`

Another way to think about it is we have two tasks to perform: 
a) splitting the data by sensitive feature (universally needed and MetricFrame currently has a great approach) 
b) passing split data to various metrics. 

I think Fairlearn will be easier to maintain if we don't have to worry about how the data should be split and how it should be passed to a given metric in a single module/class. I suggest we just offer a class/module for splitting the data. And then worry about applying metrics to the split data in separate modules, which may import/depend on the module that splits the data such that we always handle that consistently. I feel the current module is trying to do too much in one class.

I'm not really sure about how best to cope with that. One solution (which would of course break _everything_) would be to have our own names for the inputs - say `from_data` and `from_model` which should avoid the problem of existing conventions. There's then the question of how to route them to the underlying metric function. Currently we do that positionally - first argument is the 'true' column, the second is the 'predicted' column. Now since @MiroDudik 's recent PR moved `MetricFrame` itself in the direction of keyword-only arguments, one could criticise this as inconsistent too. But having to match arbitrary argument names to `MetricFrame` to arbitrary argument names in the underlying functions is... not going to be trivial or unconfusing.","2021-06-21 13:11:35","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/756#issuecomment-865021132"

Per @adrinjalali 's request :-)

I think that we've got a few things going on here:

1. It seems that when users see `y_true` and `y_pred` they may think that `MetricFrame` only works for classification metrics, rather than more generally (really, they are `column_from_data` and `column_from_model` and even that meaning is only really imposed by the underlying metric function)
2. Sometimes the two 'columns' might actually need to be multiple columns
3. Some metrics only take one of these (e.g. `selection_rate()`) and users might not want to write a wrapper for this

@kstohr  has also suggested that the 'split up by sensitive and conditional features' part of `MetricFrame` may well work better as a separate piece of functionality.","2021-06-22 13:39:38","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/756#issuecomment-865993066"

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","869697580","@riedgar-ms Yep. That sums it up. 

My reason for spitting out the `group_by` sensitive feature function is so that it can be used for descriptive stats and exploration. If you are running a metric and you are getting an error, it may be because a class is underrepresented, not represented at all, or is 'all true.' In these cases, we may need to know which class is impacted in order to handle it. In addition, it is quite common to inspect the data you are working with before passing it to a metric. 

Note:  It is ok, even preferred, if it is still a method in the class. My issue is that when you instantiate the class, it currently forces you to run a metric. It would be great to be able to perform the `group_by` function independently of running the metric. ","2021-06-28 13:44:12","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/756#issuecomment-869697580"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","876532796","# Summary

This is a second attempt to summarise the discussion to date, with the goal of reaching a conclusion. The previous summary was overly summarised.

## Current Status

As proposed at the the beginning of the thread, we are in the process of moving to requiring named arguments for `MetricFrame`. We have just released `v0.7.0` which issues a warning if positional arguments are used; with `v0.8.0` we plan to make named arguments mandatory. At that point, the signature of `MetricFrame` should be:
```python
metrics = {
  'recall': skm.recall_score,
  'accuracy': skm.accuracy_score
}

s_p = {
  'recall' : { 'sample_weights' : s_w }
  # No sample params for accuracy
}

mf = MetricFrame(metrics=metrics, y_true=y_t, y_pred=y_p,
                 sensitive_features=s_f,
                 control_features=c_f,
                 sample_params=s_p)
```
Note that the metric functions themselves are dispatched using positional arguments - the basic signature is assumed to be `metric_fn(y_true, y_pred)`. Now that we are requiring named arguments, this is an inconsistency.

## Functionality Gaps

The feedback above (and from other sources) has highlighted several gaps in the functionality of `MetricFrame`. Specifically:

- Some metrics don't take `y_pred` but `y_score` instead (often `y_pred` implies a label from a classification)
- Some metrics take more than two arguments, e.g. `inverse_propensity_score(*, actions_taken, rewards, propensities, actions_target)`
- We may have a precomputed metric (such as word error rate) and we just need it aggregated
- Some metrics only need one argument (such as `selection_rate` for which we have a custom function which ignores the `y_true` argument)
- A user may have multiple models which they wish to compare in a single `MetricFrame`

There are actually work arounds for all of these using the existing `MetricFrame`. These generally involve some combination of custom metric functions, making `y_true` and/or `y_pred` into a list of dictionaries, and filling extra arguments out via `sample_params`. The question is whether we can make the process easier.

### A note on precomputed metrics

In the above, one proposed solution for the precomputed metric problem was to have a static factory method `MetricFrame.from_precomputed()`. However, I don't think this is needed - the precomputed metrics are still per-sample, and need to be aggregated somehow. The aggregation function (such as `mean()` or `min()` is then the 'metric'. We should make sure this is documented, though.

## Proposed solutions

There are two basic ways to provide other columns - as `**kwargs` or a separate dictionary. In the following, we assume that the existing `y_true` and `y_pred` arguments get folded in eventually , although there would have to be intermediate releases (similar to the switch to named arguments).

### Providing `**kwargs`

In this case, the signature of `MetricFrame` would become
```python
mf = MetricFrame(metrics, 
                 sensitive_features=s_f,
                 control_features=c_f,
                 sample_params=s_p,
                 **direct_sample_params
)
```
and it would be invoked like:
```python
mf = MetricFrame(metrics=metrics,,
                 sensitive_features=s_f,
                 control_features=c_f,
                 sample_params=s_p,
                 y_true=y_t, y_score=y_s
)
```

However, `**kwargs` has the downside that, it is hard to add other required arguments in future, since we can be sure that whatever name we pick, we will break _someone_. Personally, I also think it makes documentation more difficult to read.

### Providing a dictionary

Rather than provide individual arguments, we can have a `direct_sample_params` dictionary. The signature would then be:
```python
mf = MetricFrame(metrics, 
                 sensitive_features=s_f,
                 control_features=c_f,
                 sample_params=s_p,
                 **direct_sample_params
)
```
and it would be invoked like:
```python
mf = MetricFrame(metrics=metrics,,
                 sensitive_features=s_f,
                 control_features=c_f,
                 sample_params=s_p,
                 direct_sample_params= { 'y_true'=y_t, 'y_score'=y_s }
)
```
This is somewhat clunkier, but does avoid the problems associated with adding extra arguments in future.

## Dispatching the Metric Functions

Regardless of how we accept the non-`y_true`/`y_pred` arguments, we then have to decide how to call the individual metric functions.

The main question is whether we are going to
1. Expect all of the metric function to accept all of the arguments passed in `direct_sample_params` (or `**direct_sample_params`); or
2. Use reflection (`inspect.signature()` I believe) to examine which functions want which arguments

Option (2) is obviously much more flexible; for example, one could do something like:
```python
metrics = {
  'metric_a' : metric_using_y_pred,
  'metric_b' : metric_using_y_score
  'metric_c' : metric_using_y_true_y_pred
  'metric_d' : metric_using_y_true_y_score
}

mf = MetricFrame(
                 metrics=metrics,,
                 sensitive_features=s_f,
                 control_features=c_f,
                 sample_params=s_p,
                 y_true=y_t, y_pred=y_p, y_score=y_s
)
```
(or similarly for the non-`**kwargs` option) and expect things to Just Work.

There are two problems with using reflection in this way. First, consider the example of a precomputed metric such as `word_error_rate`. We might want to use `numpy.mean()` as the aggregator.... but the argument for that is called `a` and not `word_error_rate`. Users would still have to write a wrapper function to make the names match.

Secondly, using reflection like this opens up a huge trap - a typo in the argument name can cause really subtle problems. If the metric function considers an argument to be mandatory (likely for something like `y_true` or `y_score`), then an error will be thrown. However, for an optional argument (think `sample_weight` vs `sample_weights` if a user were trying to pass the weights to every metric, rather than using `sample_params`) then the typo will simply stop the argument being passed, which might not be noticed for a long time (ask me about the value of `IMPLICIT NONE` and why zero initialisation is a travesty).

## Working with Streaming

PR #670 is working to add streaming to `MetricFrame`. I think that all of the above should be compatible with that, but we should keep it in mind.

I personally don't mind this inconsistency.

As for the rest of the proposal, I find it way too complicated, and not very user friendly, and hard to explain to users.

I would rather settle for a middle ground where we leave `MetricFrame` unchanged, and have a `DatasetMetricFrame` which accepts only one `y`. An API which supports all possible cases is an overly complicated one which is designed to handle 100% of the cases, we could settle for 95% and have a much simpler API, and have the other 5% use-cases do the appropriate workarounds.

We should of course accept extra input required by the metric. For example, in the case of `inverse_propensity_score`, if I understand correctly, we can have something like:

    inverse_propensity_score(
        y_pred=actions_taken,
        y_true=actions_target,
        rewards=rewards,
        propensities=propensities
    )
    
And with [SLEP006](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20350) sklearn could accept something like:

    make_scorer(inverse_propensity_score, score_params=[""rewards"", ""propensities""])

to get a scorer. Note that this has removed the need for us to do any introspection, but we have a scorer object which is a callable but also has a state.

An alternative here, since we don't actually do slicing to re-call a scorer, is to have an object which only accepts precomputed scores, like

    PrecomputedMetricFrame(
        auc=auc_score(...),
        propensity=propensity_score(....),
        ...,
        sensitive_attributes=...
    )

Or something like that.","2021-07-09 10:02:17","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/756#issuecomment-877069394"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","884919612","First, my apologies @adrinjalali  for not responding sooner.

For `MetricFrame` itself, I've very happy with leaving it with its current form (as I mentioned above).

I'm not quite sure what you're describing with `make_scorer()`. Are you saying that users would make a call along the lines of:
```python
my_metric_fn = make_scorer(inverse_propensity_score, score_params=[""rewards"", ""propensities""])
```
and then pass `my_metric_fn` to `FlexibleMetricFrame` (or whatever we call it... I'm not a huge fan of that name). This object would provide the `get_metadata_request()` method which is [mentioned in SLEP006](https://scikit-learn-enhancement-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/slep006/proposal.html#solution-each-consumer-requests), and which `FlexibleMetricFrame` could then use to route the arguments. So the user's invocation would be something like:
```python
func_dict = { 'recall' : recall_score,
            'inv_propensity': my_metric_fn }

flex_mf = FlexibleMetricFrame(metrics=func_dict,
                              y_true=y_t, y_pred=y_p, rewards=rewards, propensities=propensites,
                              sensitive_features=sf)
```
Since `recall_score` won't have `get_metadata_request()` it will only be passed `y_true` and `y_pred` (positionally). In contrast, `my_metric_fn` will respond that it wants `rewards` and `propensities` as well, and be passed them. We avoid the 'hole' of dropped arguments due to spelling errors because `make_scorer()` can check that its `score_params` all appear in the signature of the underlying function, and similarly `FlexibleMetricFrame` can check its `**kwargs` list against the results of `get_metadata_request()`.

Presumably, `FlexibleMetricFrame` (or its improved cognomen) would _not_ accept the `sample_params=` dictionaries of `MetricFrame` because that would be taken care of through `get_metadata_request()` ?","2021-07-22 13:38:27","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/756#issuecomment-884919612"

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","895141380","So what I was trying to say, is that handling the metadata routing is really not that easy, and most APIs we've tried to design are messy. The API in sklearn applies to scorers i.e. `scorer(estimator, X, y)`, rather than scoring functions i.e. `score(y_true, y_pred)`. Adding `get_metadata_request()` is certainly a way forward, but it's not an easy one.

Alternatively, we could let `AlternativeMetricFrame` to accept a scorer instead of scoring functions, and then it will be exactly in the scope of SLEP006, which would make things much easier.

I guess for now, we could have something like:

``` python
metrics = AlternativeMetricFrame(
    metrics={'roc': roc_func, 'inverse_propensity': inverse_propensity_score}
    y_true=y_true,
    y_pred=y_pred,
    rewards=rewards,
    propensities=propensities,
    routing={'inverse_propensity': ['rewards', 'propensities']}
)
```

We could also accept a scorer instead of the scoring method, but the user would also need to pass the estimator. I kinda would prefer that if we're gonna do routing.","2021-08-09 11:16:46","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/756#issuecomment-895141380"

In the pandas docs they call this ""array-like"", not sure whether they mean the exact same thing with this term as sklearn.

I am not sure whether we should try to internally deal with this by converting the array, as this might result in weird behavior when people use an ""actual"" multidimensional array.

Passing anything to `asarray` or sklearn's `check_array` fixes those inconsistencies. We can either use them or have our own validation which accepts and corrects all those issues.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","824148827","Hi! Thank you for your question. 

It is possible to measure disparities for multi class classification problems, as long as the underlying metric supports multi class classification.

'Standard' group fairness metrics such as equalized odds (=differences in FPR and FNR) and demographic parity (=differences in selection rate) can be a bit tricky to compute for multi class classification scenarios, as ""positives"" and ""negatives"" are not directly defined. One way to deal with this is to view the problem as multiple binary classification problems and aggregate the results (see for example the different options for the 'average' parameter of [precision_score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_score.html) documentation). We currently do **not** provide multi class false_positive_rate/FNR/selection_rate out of the box in Fairlearn.

However, scikit-learn does provide some performance metrics that can be applied to multi class classification problems, such as `accuracy_score` and `precision_score`. This may be relevant for you if you're trying to identify potential cases of quality of service harm (i.e., the model does not work equally well for all groups). You can use fairlearn's `MetricFrame` or `make_derived_metric` to explore disparities of these performance metrics across sensitive groups.  

For example, if we are interested to see if the model is less accurate for some groups compared to others, we can use scikit-learn's `accuracy_score` in combination with fairlearn's `MetricFrame` as follows:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from fairlearn.metrics import MetricFrame

# some random numbers
y_true = np.array([0,1,2,1,0,0,1,1])
y_pred = np.array([0,1,1,2,0,0,1,0])
sensitive_features = np.array([0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1])

# compute metric frame
mf = MetricFrame(metric=accuracy_score, 
                  y_true=y_true, y_pred=y_pred, 
                  sensitive_features=sensitive_features)
# print results
print(mf.by_group) # series with accuracy for each sensitive group
print(mf.difference()) # difference in accuracy between the two sensitive groups
```

Which will output:
```
sensitive_feature_0
0     0.5
1    0.75
Name: accuracy_score, dtype: object

0.25
```
Similarly, you could explore other performance metrics in a disaggregated way, such as recall, precision, etc. 

Alternatively, you can explicitly decompose your multi-class problem in multiple binary problems and compute the relevant metrics (e.g., `equalized_odds_difference`) for each class separately. So for example, you can compute the FPR for class 0 by replacing all 0's in `y_true`and `y_pred` by 1 (indicating that the instance belongs to class 0), and all 1's and 2's by 0 (indicating these do not belong to class 0).

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","824896594","The idea of better inter-operability with confusion matrix has come up. One way how to enable it would be to have a bit of support for metrics that output pandas series (these would be automatically treated as multiple separate metrics).

Currently, we can do the following:
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix
from fairlearn.metrics import MetricFrame
import pandas as pd

# some random numbers
y_true = np.array([0,1,2,1,0,0,1,1])
y_pred = np.array([0,1,1,2,0,0,1,0])
sensitive_features = np.array([0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1])

# pandified confusion matrix with clarifying column annotations 
def confusion_matrix_pd(y_true, y_pred):
    matrix = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred, normalize='all')
    return pd.DataFrame(matrix).rename(
               index={0: ""true=0"", 1: ""true=1"", 2: ""true=2""},
               columns={0: ""pred=0"", 1: ""pred=1"", 2: ""pred=2""}).stack()

# construct metric frame
mf = MetricFrame(metric=confusion_matrix_pd, 
                  y_true=y_true, y_pred=y_pred, 
                  sensitive_features=sensitive_features)

# mf.by_group needs to be transformed to work properly
pd.DataFrame(mf.by_group.to_dict()).T.rename_axis(index='sensitive_feature_0')
```
Which outputs this:
```
                    true=0               true=1               true=2
                    pred=0 pred=1 pred=2 pred=0 pred=1 pred=2 pred=0 pred=1 pred=2
sensitive_feature_0
0                     0.25    0.0    0.0   0.00   0.25   0.25    0.0   0.25    0.0
1                     0.50    0.0    NaN   0.25   0.25    NaN    NaN    NaN    NaN
```
However, `mf.difference()` etc. will throw errors. It might be nice to basically enable API such that we would obtain the above output without needing to the the transformation step and with `mf.difference()` etc. working columnwise.

Totally agree on documenting this. I guess the tasks here would be
- [ ] to look at the user guide of `MetricFrame` and add that new `count` metric wherever we have 2 or more metrics passed to the `MetricFrame`, and write a short sentence or two on what this does (i.e., ""show the number of people in the corresponding group"")

Long-term there is #645 to improve this structure a bit following scikit-learn's approach, but this particular issue here is really only about creating the table in the docs. 

Now the next question is where that ""sensible"" location in the docs is, of course. I don't see a related section in the website redesign Figma, so I think we need to choose one ourselves. Right now our installation instructions are in the ""Getting Started"" section, but we should have a more thorough set of installation instructions. ~~In fact, I just saw that we have a doc bug there~~ 🙁  [see UPDATE no.2 below]
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10245648/125378246-3ebfc000-e343-11eb-9392-f1436b52afb4.png)

So I suppose the best thing to do is to add an installation section to the user guide which includes
- the full installation instructions (""basic"" installation, and with extras) as well as the overview table that indicates which methods/modules require which extras (I'm writing this very generically here but it's really just `matplotlib`).
- the existing version migration guide

And then the link from the ""Getting Started"" should point at that new section, of course instead of the ~~broken~~ `advanced_install`.

@fairlearn/fairlearn-maintainers any thoughts and/or objections? 🙂 

UPDATE: ~~Amazingly, the advanced installation section still exists! I somehow assumed it must have been removed since the link doesn't work, but it's still there! https://fairlearn.org/main/contributor_guide/development_process.html#advanced-installation-instructions. As it turns out the section tag is gone, so I'll quickly add it in my v0.7.0 PR #879 since I expect it to get merged first and I really want that broken link fixed for the v0.7.0 webpage.~~

UPDATE no.2: I confused myself a bit here... the `advanced_install` tag issue was there on v0.6.2 and has since been fixed already, so nothing to be done about that. Still, you can add a link to your more general installation section from the ""Getting Started"" page. ","2021-07-13 02:02:33","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/736#issuecomment-878719624"

array(['abc,def', 'abddddd', 'a,b'], dtype='<U7')

That's also what's happening in your example since some of the sensitive feature group names are fairly long. Clearly, that shouldn't be an issue, so I'm currently looking into what can be done.

If the goal is to give people an idea of the kind of topics that are discussed, a paragraph on the website will also do. If the goal is for the community to make it easier to retrieve previous discussions, I'm not sure if it matters a lot whether it is on the website or in a hackmd (at least for those who have previously attended a call). If the goal is to keep us accountable, it makes sense to put them on the website but in that case they should probably be polished which can cause a lot of overhead. I'm not sure if that makes a lot of sense given the current level of maturity/scale of the project.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","891399627","Sure thing, @bram49 ! To be quite honest, I'm not entirely sure where this will lead. You can play around with the samples we have in the documentation https://fairlearn.org/main/user_guide/assessment.html#plotting-grouped-metrics and see if there's a good way to showcase the control features.

You can basically do the same thing with control features as with sensitive features since the `by_group` result is just the same kind of `DataFrame`. The difference comes only through aggregation which isn't really shown. Instead of showing the bars for all groups next to each other I was just wondering whether we could have some kind of separation between the control groups. It's probably not doable with a single command like we have it in the docs linked above, because you'd need to call additional plotting commands. Perhaps the plotting code @alexquach is adding in #857 can be extended to add separators between the groups. In any case, we may just come out of this exploration with the decision not to do anything special (and that's perfectly fine!). If you want to do something more well-defined I'd suggest #666. I can walk you through what's been done on that before since I pair-programmed with @rishabhsamb on that.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","833025393","@rishabhsamb expressed some interest in this, so I wanted to make sure we agree on all the basics. In my description above it looks like a standalone function. I think that's also our only option since `MetricFrame` doesn't take multiple predictions. That is, unless we're willing to extend `MetricFrame` towards multiple models/sets of predictions(?). I'm assuming we don't (at least not in the short term), so @rishabhsamb could implement this as 
```
plot_model_comparison(
    metrics,
    y_true, 
    y_preds={""model 1"": y_pred_1, ""model 2"": y_pred_2, ... }, 
    sensitive_features, show_plot=True)
```
But there are still a few different things to choose here such as:
- Should `metrics` include some indication on which one is on the x-axis and which one is on the y-axis? Or do we just randomly choose that?
- Related: Is `metrics` a set of arbitrarily many metrics? If so, do we generate all combinations as charts? Or do we restrict it to just two? In that case, would it be simpler to provide both explicitly as `x_metric`, `y_metric`. In the existing dashboard x is always the ""performance"" metric and y is always the ""fairness"" metric. We could also make that restriction.
- How do we specify the metrics? Simply putting `selection_rate` isn't sufficient, since we may want to evaluate the `group_max`, `group_min`, `ratio`, or `difference`. 

After thinking through these questions I'm thinking of the following
```
plot_model_comparison(
    x_metric=accuracy_score,  # no default value, this is just for illustrative purposes
    x_metric_aggregator=None,  # optional, default None (means ""overall"")
    y_metric=selection_rate,  # no default value, this is just for illustrative purposes
    y_metric_aggregator=""group_max"",  # optional, default None (means ""overall"")
    y_true, 
    y_preds={""model 1"": y_pred_1, ""model 2"": y_pred_2, ... }, 
    sensitive_features, show_plot=True)
```
which would then proceed to plot overall accuracy on the x-axis (the value you get from `MetricFrame.overall`) and demographic parity difference or, in other words, `MetricFrame.difference()` based on `selection_rate`. If the aggregation isn't needed it can be left out (i.e., it's an optional arg). I would also expect that `y_preds` has to be a dictionary (or `DataFrame`?), not just a single prediction, because this is meant to be a scatter plot after all.

@fairlearn/fairlearn-maintainers wdyt? Also, @rishabhsamb please chime in with your own thoughts. I realize I may be missing some pieces or skipping over important details.","2021-05-05 21:39:21","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/666#issuecomment-833025393"

I'm not sure, an `inspection` module makes more sense to me for this.

I guess ideally, the user would have like a few different models and maybe one or two or more grid search CV done on a few hyper parameter sets, and would like to visualize those results.

Have you looked in to the outputs [`GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV)? We could utilize `cv_results_` and `multimetric_` for instance, just an idea to explore.

> - How do we specify the metrics? Simply putting `selection_rate` isn't sufficient, since we may want to evaluate the `group_max`, `group_min`, `ratio`, or `difference`. 

I would discourage us from incorporating these concepts into the signature of such a function. I would rather have simple metric functions as X and Y, and whatever logic needs to be there, is in that function. We have a bunch of `y_pred` (or estimators for that matter), one `y_true`, and the sensitive feature, and that's enough.","2021-05-06 06:01:11","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/666#issuecomment-833250173"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","833281198","Regarding the module, it seemed just intuitive to have it with metrics since this is basically a metrics visualization. That's not a terribly important point for me, though, so whatever works for people is fine by me.

Note that this isn't just for `GridSearch` either. I can plug in my original model, a postprocessed model, and an `ExponentiatedGradient` model and compare the three of them without touching `GridSearch` at all. Ideally I'd like it to be generic enough to support such use cases.

I understand the concern with exposing so many knobs on the metric aggregation. However, I'm not sure how else you will achieve the same outcome. This isn't just the simple metric, but aggregations of that metric between the groups. If I need to plot the overall accuracy score vs. selection rate difference there isn't really another way to express that (as far as I can tell) other than
- having two args per axis like I described above (metric + aggregator)
- creating a new object that encapsulates metric + aggregator, and pass that object for each axis. I don't like creating new objects that people aren't familiar with, though.
- defining different functions `plot_model_comparison_*` where the `*` would be all kinds of variations of aggregating a certain way on x and y axis. That's obviously a ton of combinations and not really a good option.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","833289795","That matches my expectation exactly. But for each of those 3 models I have many choices for what the axes should be.

    x_metric=accuracy_score,
    y_metric=selection_rate,
    y_true, 
    y_preds={""model 1"": y_pred_1, ""model 2"": y_pred_2, ... },

How does this function internally know whether I want
- the overall accuracy and selection rate (i.e., ignoring sensitive features)
- the min (or max, although in this case that wouldn't make sense) accuracy or selection rate
- the difference between max and min accuracy and selection rates
- the ratio of min and max accuracy and selection rates
- OR most likely: a combination thereof, like what I specified in my example with overall accuracy of the model (aka ""performance metric"") and the selection rate difference (aka ""fairness metric"").

I see no way of expressing that without args, hence:
```
plot_model_comparison(

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","833293604","The `plot_model_comparison` would expect the metric function to have one of the two signatures:

- `metric(y_true, y_pred, sensitive_attribute)`

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","833316205","I had thought about a similar option, but I still think it would cause some extra trouble for users. `equalized_odds_ratio` is already defined, but what about just getting the group with minimum accuracy? Thinking about this a bit more, you can define variations of aggregations for each kind of metric (at least min, max, diff, ratio), but we didn't want that many custom ones like `equalized_odds_ratio`. Otherwise we'll end up with #metrics x #aggregations (and potentially multiplied by # options within those aggregations, as you've demonstrated with `method=""max""`) custom functions. 

That leaves users with something like this:
```
def accuracy_score_min(y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features):
    MetricFrame(accuracy_score, y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features=sensitive_features).group_min()
plot_model_comparison(..., y_metric=accuracy_score_min,...)
```
It's more flexible than what I proposed in that my proposal can't accommodate the `method` argument. It does still feel like quite a lot to write given that the key idea is easy to express. One could put it all in the same line with a `lambda` but that certainly doesn't help in making this readable.

The middle path would be to still go with your suggestion, but create ""shortcuts"" like `equalized_odds_ratio` for the most common ones. I imagine there are somewhere between 10 and 20 of them so perhaps it's not quite as dramatic as I explained with my estimate above.

I certainly like having fewer arguments and for me that pretty much overrules any concerns I've mentioned. I'm just wondering whether there's another way to avoid creating so many custom functions.","2021-05-06 07:58:19","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/666#issuecomment-833316205"

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","752695357","Hi @shngt ! Welcome to the Fairlearn community! I think the currently suggested change in this issue is to create a separate `ThresholdOptimizer` instance per control feature value, e.g. if we have three of them (`high`, `medium`, and `low` from the feature `income`) then we'd pass only the subset of `X` and `y` corresponding to the control feature value to each instance. That sounds simple enough to do. However, the potentially tricky part is the structure (more below). I think this is a fine issue to start on once we sort out what that should look like. [I was planning to open a few other issues that would be great starting points, so I'll do that now to give you some more choices. I'd be happy to walk you through any of them if you have questions.]

Re: structure --> Since @MiroDudik 's change a little while ago we already have a fairly nice separation of logic in `ThresholdOptimizer` and `InterpolatedThresholder`. At first glance this should be as simple as replacing [this line](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/blob/43532d83656b4c3cced275f5de9930761bd44f01/fairlearn/postprocessing/_threshold_optimizer.py#L227) with a for-loop to do the same with each control feature, and then repeating that process for the prediction methods. Alternatively, if no control features are specified, one would just use the entire dataset. The passing of `control_features` is currently a bit obscure since it's not explicitly spelled out in the API. I'm opening a ""discussion"" (https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/discussions/664) for that, but it is certainly possible to pass `control_features` even now. For `ThresholdOptimizer` this currently results in an exception (by design since that's what this issue is for).

@MiroDudik and @riedgar-ms  may have thoughts on this, and perhaps @adrinjalali since we've talked about `ThresholdOptimizer` code before. Obviously everyone's feedback would be highly appreciated.","2020-12-30 17:16:55","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/660#issuecomment-752695357"

The way I see this working is that each metric would be responsible for its own accumulations, and we'd make a copy of the relevant object for each detected sensitive feature combination.

**(2) To incorporate some initial efficient implementations** (say for the metrics based on keeping track of the contingency table), we could allow strings as metrics, similarly to [pd.SeriesGroupBy.aggregate](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.core.groupby.SeriesGroupBy.aggregate.html), e.g.,
```python
mf = flm.MetricFrame('accuracy_score', y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features=sf)
mf.add_data(y_true_new, y_pred_new, sensitive_features=sf_new)

mf = flm.MetricFrame(['accuracy_score', 'false_positive_rate', 'false_negative_rate'],

**(3) For streaming setting, it would be much nicer to support a constructor / add_data pattern** of the following form:

mf.add_data(y_true_next, y_pred_next, sensitive_features=sf_next)

```python
mf = flm.MetricFrame('accuracy_score', [], [], sensitive_features=[])
mf.add_data(y_true_next, y_pred_next, sensitive_features=sf_next)

I'm not completely sure how to do this right (without making the consructor work with generic `*args` which would hide the meaning). There might be some alternative via [@classmethod](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12179271/meaning-of-classmethod-and-staticmethod-for-beginner)? Something like:

metrics are pretty much functions, they don't have the concept of storing stuff, at least most of the ones we have right now don't. So it'd be the `MetricFrame` which would store data.

> We could even support some ""standard"" lists that we have found useful?

I don't think standard lists would be required, it adds quite a bit of complexity to the API I think, and it's outside the scope of this issue anyway.

> (3) That classmethod would be a factory :-)

We probably don't need a factory, it's just the constructor which takes an extra parameter and makes the `MetricFrame` to store stuff or not.

For the parameter, I'd go with:

```
streaming: bool, default=False
    False: the object does not support streaming and `add_data` would raise.
    True: the object supports streaming.
```

It wouldn't be the users' responsibility to know which metrics support streaming and which ones don't. To begin with, we store the data fed to the `MetricFrame` and pass it each time to the underlying metric. It's not the most efficient implementation, but it does the job. In later iterations, we can start by adding support for certain commonly used metrics by implementing them ourselves in a update-able efficient way and enhance the `MetricFrame` implementation, w/o any change on the user/API side.","2020-12-20 19:09:06","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/655#issuecomment-748647889"

Storing all the data as it comes in is certainly inefficient, since we would have to just store it, and reprocess everything for each update call. Specialised streaming metrics could be more efficient - for example by building a confusion matrix, and updating the counts for new data (we can't do this within `MetricFrame` because it's much more general than CM-based classification metrics).

@Dref360 -- do you want to get started with that?

The next step is going to be to enable some efficient implementations. I see several options:

**Option 1**. We allow `pytorch_lightning.metrics.Metric` objects in the constructor, e.g.,

```python
import pytorch_lightning.metrics as plm
import fairlearn.metrics as flm

mf = flm.MetricFrame({'accuracy': plm.Accuracy, 'f1': plm.F1},
                     [], [], sensitive_features=[], streaming=True)
```

This sets up a pattern where we could continue adding support for other metric styles, e.g., we might add `tf.keras.metrics.Metric` etc.

  * the upside is that this will immediately provide access to many metrics beyond `sklearn.metrics`
  * the downside is that we're now creating a dependency on other packages

**Option 2**. We create our own streaming metric interface. The implication is that we would then need to build wrappers for `pytorch_lightning.metrics.Metric`, `tf.keras.metrics.Metric`, etc. The downside is that we are creating another new API for users to deal with.

**Option 3**. We create our own efficient streaming implementation that could be accessed via string, e.g.,
```python
mf = flm.MetricFrame(['accuracy_score', 'f1_score'],
                     [], [], sensitive_features=[], streaming=True)
```
In this case, we would create our own internal API for streaming metrics, but we wouldn't need to obsess about it too much (since we wouldn't be exporting it, so we could easily change it later). This is compatible with Option 1 above (we would be able to build our internal wrappers for this internal API).

Could you expand a bit on how you feel these notebooks demonstrate a fairness issue? Also, we're in the process of moving Fairlearn into a separate organisation; it's not going to be Microsoft-controlled going forwards.

I have a memory that HDF5 ran into trouble because they couldn't dot all i's and cross all t's on who had made code contributions. Having said that, I don't remember the details.

On the other side, DCO is a point of friction which is counterproductive to attracting more contributors from the community.

Also, this is only important and relevant for major contributions. The fixes, website improvements, small doc improvements, etc are of no risk, and for the major ones, we can and should of course either trust the contributor or ask if we're allowed to use the code, if there is any suspicion. I personally have been in a situation where I had to contact the author of an implementation to ask if I'm allowed to look at their code, and in that case I wasn't given the permission, so had to implement from the paper itself.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","737346595","If the intention here is to demonstrate the value of Fairlearn 0.50, it might be productive to try using the guidelines in [Contributing example notebooks](https://fairlearn.github.io/v0.5.0/contributor_guide/contributing_example_notebooks.html).  If there's a different intention - eg, advocating for not building particular kinds of ML systems, illustrating a concept for educational purposes, reaching an audience other than potential Fairlearn users - it might help to articulate that intention in the pull request description.  That can help sort out feedback on the intention itself vs. feedback on execution.

From the notes, it sounds like there might be an abstraction trap (Selbst et al. 2019) around focusing on the dataset, rather than a deployment context.  [The myth of generalisability in clinical research and machine learning in health care (Futoma 2020)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(20)30186-2/fulltext) might be helpful for thinking through that:
> ...the desire for geographical generalisability is a proxy for validity... In situations with strong signals and little local variability across sites, this strategy might make sense. However, in many scenarios there are too many practice patterns and other local idiosyncrasies that make learning a broadly applicable model effectively impossible. Instead, machine learning systems in these settings can be viewed as an aspirational form of evidence-based medicine—local data to create local inferences for local patients and clinicians... If hospitals want to have useful machine learning systems at the bedside, the broader research community need to stop focusing solely on generalisability and consider the ultimate goal: will this system be useful in this specific case?

Also, I agree that focusing on the labeling procedure seems critical:

> ...we note that across these models, our source of diagnostic labels for these images must be considered at best “silver” labels, as all currently existing public chest X-ray datasets use automatically determined labels based on natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract labels from the radiology reports. These silver labels may be incorrect, in ways that could compound with observe biases or model errors, a risk that warrants further investigation. [(Seyyed-Kalantari et al. 2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00827.pdf)

If there isn't even real labeled data, would that influence whether how a practitioner might weight the tradeoffs when deploying into a particular deployment context?  This seems really important.

If the intention in this work is to write notebook code, a minimal step could be to model the upstream errors in labeling and illustrate how that error propagates to any downstream metrics (eg, add 10% labeling error to the dataset, and show how that leads to noise in downstream metrics over 1000 simuations).","2020-12-02 16:33:42","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/648#issuecomment-737346595"

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","728780655","@MarsLabAtSLU There was an additional issue to fix. In case you are eager to build a dashboard manually in the meanwhile:

When running two dashboards with different ports they ran into a name collision of the functions with the `route` decorator. To fix that I defined the function without `route` decorator, renamed the function to be unique (by using the associated port below) and then applied `add_url_rule` manually instead of through the `route` decorator
```
def visual():
    ....
visual.__name__ = f""visual{self._service.port}""
self._service.app.add_url_rule('/', endpoint=visual.__name__, view_func=visual)
```
This has to be done for every function with a route decorator, including the one that is used to request metrics.

Since this is  
- neither a real issue the released dashboard is facing (since it's not on flask)
- nor will it become one for Fairlearn because the dashboard will be removed shortly
I am closing this issue and the associated pull request. 

Thanks @MarsLabAtSLU for your suggestion! Stay tuned for the upcoming release of `raiwidgets` which will provide a flask-based version of the fairness dashboard (and some new features).","2020-11-17 08:47:34","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/629#issuecomment-728780655"

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","719857678","@bwuzhang thanks for reporting this!
I'm able to reproduce this with the steps you've outlined. I believe that it isn't a bug, though. Let me try to explain:

The notebook itself outputs this table somewhere earlier:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10245648/97766119-51a2a500-1ad2-11eb-976a-53c06ef8e0c6.png)

From this we can tell that the vast majority of rows (people!) are marked with race ""white"", so the dataset isn't well balanced in terms of race. Further, it looks like almost 97% of the white students passed (label 1), and about 78% of black students passed. Again, this tells us that the dataset isn't well balanced, this time with respect to labels 0 and 1. 

Let's take a step back and examine what `DemographicParity(ratio_bound=0.98)` actually means. What we're hoping to achieve with this formulation is that every group is within 2 percentage points (`1-0.98=0.02`, ignoring the ratio bound slack here for a minute) of the group with maximum selection rate. Let's look at the dataset itself. If we used that as a comparison, we'd get roughly `0.78/0.97`, which is about `0.8` and that's far below `0.98`. So `ExponentiatedGradient` tries to get the selection rates of both groups close to each other (so that min divided by max is at least `0.98`) while at the same time trying to optimize accuracy. 

I actually think it would be intuitive if it used dummy classifiers (constant label 1 for everyone), since that makes the ratio exactly 1. So that's exactly how it starts out. The following iterations are not dummy classifiers, though:

```
'predictors_': 
 0    DummyClassifier(constant=1, strategy='constant')
 1              LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear')
 2              LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear')
 3              LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear')
 4              LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear')
```

From the resulting weights we can tell that it doesn't even include the initial dummy classifier in the final solution:
```
'weights_':
 0    0.000000
 1    0.546098
 2    0.000000
 3    0.000000
 4    0.453902
```
We could look further into the classifiers 1 and 4, but I don't think that was necessarily what you asked. I agree that it is confusing that it keeps printing out
```
DEBUG:fairlearn.reductions._exponentiated_gradient._lagrangian:redY had single value. Using DummyClassifier
```
in every iteration. @MiroDudik is that perhaps because it's the first attempt, and then it tries different values of `mul` from `1` to `10` which produce better results?

I don't quite have a good and simple explanation for why it never occurred with `ratio_bound=0.99`, but always with `ratio_bound=0.98`.

It was quite puzzling to me that the resulting selection rates are so low. Given that the dataset was so imbalanced, I would have expected them to be higher. Given that we care about ranking here it's perhaps not all that important. More important is the order, or the threshold(s) we set for admitting students.

I think this is a wonderful reminder for us to finally write a thorough user guide for our reductions techniques. @riedgar-ms started summarizing some of the background on these techniques in the past, and we should perhaps revive that effort. I don't think we can expect users to piece this together without documentation.","2020-10-31 00:38:21","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/611#issuecomment-719857678"

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","716061830","Yes! This is related to https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn-proposals/blob/master/ui/migration.md . In short:
- The existing `FairlearnDashboard` will be migrated out of Fairlearn shortly (after the v0.5.0 release which will happen as soon as the metrics API is finalized) for reasons outlined in that link.
- At that point we'll complete #561 and update the documentation including the getting started page to show these plots instead. As you pointed out it's much better to have the plots actually render without having to download it first.

I'm hoping we can expand on these charts as well, since they provide very minimal functionality at this point. It's a good start, though! 

I think this issue is a good way to ""track"" the effort to update the docs after the `FairlearnDashboard` is removed, so I'd propose to leave it open. I'll assign it to myself since I promised to take care of the removal and docs update, but I'm very much looking for feedback on the resulting docs. I'll make sure to tag you on the PR(s).

I'm a little confused, though. `ThresholdOptimizer` is deterministic except for the `predict` call (which is why the `random_state` is only available there). Small caveat: it assumes the underlying estimator is deterministic. If that's not the case then all bets are off.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","701945685","Thanks, Roman! After some further inspection it seems the problem is some confusion on my side on what `random_state` in the `predict` call does. I assumed that if I run a cell that contains ```to.predict(X, sensitive_features=A, random_state=0)``` twice, I would get the same predictions. But that does not seem to be the case?

This is the full code in which I ran in to this problem first:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from fairlearn.postprocessing import ThresholdOptimizer

# fetch data from OpenML
data = fetch_openml(data_id=42193)
X = pd.DataFrame(data['data'], columns=data['feature_names']).drop(columns=['race_Caucasian', 'c_charge_degree_F'])
y = data['target'].astype(np.int)

# split the data in train-validation-test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.20, random_state=0)
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.25, random_state=0)

# Train a simple logistic regression model
lr = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000, random_state=0)
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Train threshold optimizer
to = ThresholdOptimizer(estimator=lr, constraints='equalized_odds', grid_size=1000)
to.fit(X_train, y_train, sensitive_features=X_train['race_African-American'])
```

My expectation was that running the following cell twice would give the same results, but I get different predictions each time:
```python
# score groups
y_val_pred = to.predict(X_val, sensitive_features=X_val['race_African-American'], random_state=0)

I suspect we'll find the same issue with `ExponentiatedGradient` since it also relies on passing `sample_weight` to the estimator. What I don't quite understand in your example is how the pipeline knows that it's for that step since the step is named `logistic` but you prefix the key with `logisticregression`. Is that perhaps an issue with the example?

I like your proposed solution! @MiroDudik do you have thoughts (since this would be an API change/extension)?

What this really makes me think about is whether we are looking at this a bit backwards. @adrinjalali may have thoughts on this. If we use a pipeline like the one in your example, shouldn't the mitigation technique be applied after the scaling, i.e. shouldn't the mitigation technique be a part of the pipeline?

Yes, sklearn does not know the name of the step, it just show `logisticregression__sample_weight`. In reality, it should be `logistic__sample_weight` (from the name I put in the Pipeline arguments).

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","696108644","An update on my earlier comment, now that I've woken up a bit more. If I understand @adrinjalali  correctly, when trying to use Fairlearn in a pipeline, the Fairlearn estimator should go into the pipeline itself. The line to construct the pipeline should look something like:
```python
self.estimator = Pipeline([('scaler', StandardScaler()), ('estimator', GridSearch(LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear'), constraint=DemographicParity()))]
```
which definitely makes sense, and should work as-is (we should check this, though). It feels odd to have some external algorithm (such as `GridSearch`) 'reach in' to just one part of the Pipeline.

However, we could consider having the argument name override capability, to allow ourselves a little more flexibility in supported estimators, if we found some common package which (for example) used `sample_weights` instead of `sample_weight`.  We might prefer just to tell users to write a wrapper for such cases, though.","2020-09-21 13:18:07","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/580#issuecomment-696108644"

Isn't that the original example @Dref360 is showing? That seems to be in contrast with your earlier comment @adrinjalali . Perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

What Richard drew up is basically what I meant originally, although I don't know if that's preferable to having `GridSearch` wrap the pipeline. A quick search showed one `sklearn` example with `GridSearchCV` wrapping `Pipeline`, but I can't tell whether that's a pattern to copy.","2020-09-21 19:55:33","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/580#issuecomment-696337840"

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","697016786","@adrinjalali I agree that that's how it should be, but right now it isn't. There's one potential problem that (at least in my mind) is keeping us from doing it this way. `GridSearch` (ours, not `sklearn`) creates a grid with certain properties, not just a grid that is created by combining all options from all parameters with each other (which would be the Cartesian Product). [You may argue that that's not even a ""grid"" in the way most people think about it.]
One can either pass some of the information about what the grid should be like (including size as in number of grid points, and limits of the values in each dimensions) or directly pass a predefined grid. Since this isn't just a simple Cartesian Product I'm not entirely sure we can actually use `GridSearchCV` without a workaround. Is it possible to pass non-scalars (say, a column of the predefined grid) to `GridSearchCV`? Let's say the following:

```
args = {'grid' = [[1,0,0,0], [0,0,1,0], ...]}
```

If that works then we could define a small estimator that just does what `GridSearch` right now does, but with that one column vector (single `fit`) as opposed to a grid (`n` calls to `fit`), and then use `GridSearchCV` around the pipeline that contains that estimator.

`InterpolatedThresholder` is from postprocessing, so that's not directly related to this, but perhaps you were trying to point at something else?","2020-09-22 22:31:39","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/580#issuecomment-697016786"

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","843398325","Whoever takes this up should probably run `ThresholdOptimizer` with `prefit=True` and `prefit=False` with several different kinds of models (e.g., one from `sklearn`, one from `pytorch`, one from `lightgbm`, etc.) and see whether the result is as expected.

The same code should be used for writing test cases. We'd want to cover the same spectrum.

Regardless, the experience should be that we first explain what `prefit` is (i.e., a flag indicating whether the model is already trained and doesn't need to be trained by the postprocessing technique), then note that it's been set a certain way (while indicating the default), and then only explain the options like above. Importantly, it should be clear to a user who doesn't specify `prefit` (i.e., uses the default) whether they can continue or whether they should fix something.

The issue at the heart of this is that we use `sklearn`'s `check_is_fitted` which only works properly when the estimator actually conforms to `sklearn`'s convention. In other cases, `check_is_fitted` may not recognize that a model is already trained and complain like above in @arjsingh's description.","2021-05-18 17:45:57","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/564#issuecomment-843398325"

GLM is only usable with `GridSearch`, while BGL is usable with `GridSearch` and `ExponentiatedGradient`. [When using BGL with `ExponentiatedGradient` you need to provide the `upper_bound` argument.] Otherwise they should behave the same way.

Please let me know if there are other questions! We definitely need to write a set of changes from v0.4.6 to v-next and publish them on the webpage (besides CHANGES.md). Since it's also related: the multi-version support on the webpage that @riedgar-ms  is working on will be very useful.","2020-08-13 05:41:16","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/556#issuecomment-673272791"

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","674158022","@nina-hua hello!  If you're trying to make the case at work for using these assessment and mitigation approaches, it can really help to frame the impact in terms of how it reduces real harms to real people.

If you're into research papers, [Language (Technology) is Power: A Critical Survey of “Bias” in NLP (Blodget et al. 2020)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.485.pdf) suggest some ways to approach fairness work that can lead to more productive conversations than focusing on bias alone. 

More practically, in my experience the aggregation in the Boston housing dataset means it's particularly challenging to use as a kind of proof of concept for this kind of fairness work.  You really need a task that's embedded in some social system to talk about harms, and to translate the impact of fairness metrics to accessible human terms so that various stakeholders can see why the work matters and is worth doing.

I'd be happy to collaborate or chat more about scenarios or datasets that might be more directly relevant for your work, or that might help you with kicking off those conversation on your team.

If you really want to use it you could perhaps write a wrapper for your regressor that has `sample_weight` in the `fit` method and handles the reweighting.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","687197284","I've been prodding this, and changing `.size()` to `.count()` in `UtilityParity.load_data()` doesn't seem to be a complete fix. For starters, making that change results in almost every test of ExpGrad failing. This is perhaps not surprising, since `size()` returns an integer, whereas `count()` will return a DataFrame.

I have a test case [in a branch](https://github.com/riedgar-ms/fairlearn/blob/riedgar-ms/vacuous-constraint-fix/test/unit/reductions/exponentiated_gradient/test_vacuousconstraints.py) which shows the bug.

The actual code doesn't blow up until `signed_weights()` is called in `UtilityParity`. At that point, the `lambda_vec` is an empty Series, so attempts to index it fail miserably.

I don't quite understand enough of what's going on to propose a fix. We could have `signed_weights()` check for an empty `lambda_vec` (similarly for `project_lambda()`) and return an empty Series when that happens. We would also have to adjust everything which looks at `self.index` in `UtilityParity` too, to cope with the vacuous case.","2020-09-04 14:53:06","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/543#issuecomment-687197284"

#  Create a dictionary of model(s) you want to assess for fairness

ys_pred = unmitigated_predictor.predict(X_test)

                                    prediction_type='binary_classification')
```
the variable `ys_pred` is supposed to be a `(str,array)` dictionary, where the key is the name of the (registered) model. The code in the [example notebooks](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/contrib/fairness/upload-fairness-dashboard.ipynb) does this, and should work.

Also, for some reason they don't even include the 3.7 wheel in their release: https://pypi.org/project/shap/#files and that's why installing on a 3.7 environment tries to compile the package from source.

@adrinjalali have you any suggestions for managing this form of dependency hell?

Spawning off specialised files like that strikes me as non-ideal.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","917722697","Hi @romanlutz, I went through all the issues cited (though did not do a deep dive into the research papers linked). @koaning  has linked a few resources, here and elsewhere, that provide good starting places!

List of resources:
- The original [paper](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/22636/0000186.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) that introduced the boston housting dataset
- [Issue 466](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues/466) discusses porting `Demographic Parity Classifier` and `Equal Opportunity` from scikit-fairness to fairlearn, and Kevin suggests using the Boston housing dataset as an example
- Boston housing dataset used for fairness walkthrough: https://scikit-lego.netlify.app/fairness.html, same as https://scikit-fairness.netlify.app/fairness_boston_housing.html. I think this guide is pretty thorough, though
- [Benchmark notebook using boston dataset](https://gist.github.com/koaning/1a606e07c9b27d1889ada4185959d87a) from [issue 430](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues/430#issuecomment-632690069) that tests out `InformationFilter` and `CorrelationRemover`. Findings: (1) the hyperparameter alpha should not be constrained to (0,1) and (2) that two functions should be moved to fairlearn from scikit-fairness, `GramSmidthFilter` (aka `InformationFilter`?) and `CorrelationRemover`. 
- A [discussion in scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/16155) about how one of the columns in the boston dataset encodes systemic racism, and the subsequent `FairnessWarning` now included in the dataset load. I don't know if the problematic column `B` is still in the dataset as implemented in fairlearn or if it was removed?
- In [issue 31 of scikit-fairness](https://github.com/koaning/scikit-fairness/issues/31), the user who raised most of the fetch_boston comments suggests taking a sociotechnical approach to the user guide by explaining how a team of diverse participants, some technical and some not, might be able to offer different perspectives on the dataset. Is that an approach we would want to take in the documentation? So not just highlighting the technical issues that other users have cited before in other comments and other repositories, but maybe a way of using fairlearn to address all the additional feedback different stakeholders might have about the data. 
- The purpose of the boston dataset was originally to measure air quality! I definitely think we should address that, given how differently it's used now.
-[Issue 435](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues/435) discusses scikit-learn phasing out the boston dataset, but given that this issue is a year old it may be overcome by events.

I am curious as to whether you have any ideas about what we might want to touch upon that goes beyond koanig's [tutorial](https://scikit-fairness.netlify.app/fairness_boston_housing.html). Maybe we could adapt that analysis for fairlearn and add some of the in- and post-processing functionalities to test outcomes? 

Overall, I am thinking the user guide post could have a structure as follows:
1. Introduction to the boston housing dataset - where does it come from, where is it currently used, where is it deprecated
2. Issues with the dataset - display via summary statistics and a 'typical' prediction pipeline. Here we can also talk in depth about scikit-learn issue #16155.
3. Run through the diagnostic analysis in the scikit-fairness blog post, adjusting for changes in fairlearn syntax
4. Discussion about what we found, how well different processing methods work at achieving some fairness goal, and general recommendations about using the dataset

Please let me know what you think!","2021-09-12 22:33:47","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/507#issuecomment-917722697"

Some thoughts:
- `CorrelationRemover` is already part of Fairlearn thanks to @koaning https://fairlearn.org/main/api_reference/fairlearn.preprocessing.html#fairlearn.preprocessing.CorrelationRemover
- We never did anything to the dataset so it should be in the original configuration. In fact, you can try calling `fetch_boston` and the `feature_names` should include the `B` column. For me it shows `['CRIM', 'ZN', 'INDUS', 'CHAS', 'NOX', 'RM', 'AGE', 'DIS', 'RAD', 'TAX', 'PTRATIO', 'B', 'LSTAT']`. I think the main reason for including it in Fairlearn is to show this bad example.
- Writing about the origin of the dataset and then considering how it's been used since is absolutely important. I would say that already captures some of the issues. One can be arbitrarily ambitious with this, but I've found it to be beneficial to start small and iterate on that. Kevin outlined a pretty ambitious agenda that would be awesome to get to IMO, but it also requires a lot of time from several people. This documentation might provide the foundation for this to happen eventually.
- I like your outline. I'm not 100% sure about using the mitigation techniques because I really feel like putting the dataset first. On the other hand, I don't quite know what you have in mind there (as in ""what are you trying to show using the mitigation techniques?"") so I'm definitely open to looking into it. The first three points you made are definitely 100% in line with what I thought of.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","928348815","There's a lot I like about this and huge kudos for creating this summary. Personally, I struggle with commenting on Jupyter notebooks because there's no way to use a ""comment on line xyz"" functionality. We could either add it as a user guide section (which is what I was thinking) OR an example notebook. In either case you\d need to create a PR against the Fairlearn repo so that we can provide feedback by line.

@hildeweerts @mmadaio how do you feel about user guide vs. example notebook? I'm leaning user guide.

### If it's a user guide section
Copy the content into a restructured text (`.rst`) file? I'm thinking a new file under `docs/user_guide`, perhaps `datasets.rst`. That would need to be listed in the corresponding `index.rst`. This is the first such dataset investigation (of hopefully many!) so we can create subsections/-pages there eventually but you can just use `datasets.rst` to start with. Restructured text is formatted differently, but I wouldn't worry too much about it for now. I think we're just looking high-level and then progressing to details (structure, goals, then content, eventually phrasing, formatting). 

### If it's an example notebook

To have it render in our ""examples"" section you'd need to convert it to a `.py` file. A tool like [jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using-cli.html) should do the trick. Then just drop it into `examples and make sure the file name starts with `plot_`

### Advice that applies in both cases

Then you can build the docs using instructions from https://fairlearn.org/main/contributor_guide/contributing_documentation.html

In 90% of the cases people don’t know that there’s something they can help with unless the issue owners say so. That’s why we have to be proactive about marking things as “help wanted” before anyone even asks.

As for the task lists: issues are threads so posting at the bottom gets tedious. That also means it changes through the thread. Task lists are built to be updatable. The project mgmt tool might allow notes on the board with the full list as well, but so far I’ve found it to be too much overhead to use. From what I’ve heard from people they look at issues so that’s probably the best place.

Having separate boards per workstream might work. ","2020-06-22 15:21:15","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/504#issuecomment-647586185"

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","646884143","Thanks for sharing! I may have a different mental model of this than others but in my mind this maps almost 1-to-1 as follows:

- “try this right now” —> user guide, section on fairness 
- “domain-specific guides” —> example notebooks (unless these are broader than individual cases, then perhaps it would be more appropriate in a different way such as having domain-specific pages with various notebooks from that domain and additional information relevant to the domain)
- “learning more” doesn’t quite fit into a single place, of course.

As we pointed out this focus would warrant a shift in terms of at least the landing page structure since these are the topics that we want people to engage with.

I’m curious how you feel about the mapping above and what pieces you think need to change to highlight this focus properly. I’ve pointed out the landing page as one but perhaps it’s not limited to that.","2020-06-19 22:37:00","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/498#issuecomment-646884143"

The other environments mentioned that are not jupyter notebook-based will not work with the current communication layer.

It still doesn't show the dashboard, but also doesn't give an error. I am not sure, but it looks like the dashboard can't find the widget's `js` libraries, as it tries to load them relative to the current URL, but it does not seem like Jupyter actually exposes those URLs? Hence a `404`?

@romanlutz, restarting the kernel and refreshing doesn't resolve it for me. Even restarting the entire compute instance and rerunning the notebook doesn't help!

Short-term:
- Using a new compute and installing with pip worked (with the usual reloading of page & kernel)
- Using a new compute and installing with conda worked, although it was very flaky with sometimes several retries required to make the dashboard show. For me it seemed to help to run `conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets` after the fairlearn installation (i.e. after line 3 in your snippet above) and the dashboard showed up consistently afterwards.

Long-term: I'm working on replacing the `ipywidgets` based dashboard with a flask based dashboard that shouldn't have this issue and that shouldn't have the issue requiring restarts of page & kernel.

Clearly, this kind of experience isn't ideal and a good motivation to improve things. That's why we're about to release `raiwidgets` as a separate package.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","644998462","There are many ways you can do it. The way it's done in scikit-learn is that the CI pushes the docs to the website for each release branch, i.e. any branch whose name looks like a major release, plus sending master's compiled docs to `/dev`. The release manager sets what `stable` points to, manually, in what you see in step 7 of [this guide](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/doc/developers/maintainer.rst), which comes after

> For major/minor (not bug-fix release), update the symlink for stable and the latestStable variable


Buf fix releases simply change the release branch and therefore the docs will be updated for that branch.

You can modify this pipeline to have pushing the docs done half manually (with push of a button somewhere) if you want more control.

One thing I want to definitely also mention w.r.t. this example: this may be one of those cases where tech shouldn't be used at all, or at least not in the form of these COMPAS scores.

1. `thr_optimizer = ThresholdOptimizer(constraints=..., objective_cost_matrix=[[0,1],[1,0]], ...)`

Fundamentally, we need to get better about compatibility (which is what my PR over in `fairlearn-proposals` is about). Of course, the build is currently checking _forwards_ compatibility, which is necessarily going to break as features are added (although I believe that the current issues are simply due to naming instability). To keep this build green through such changes, we would need to have tests and notebooks declare their 'minimum supported version.'

Having the documentation versioned is related, and very good to have, but doesn't solve the issue that we have too many breaking changes too often.

What you’re proposing is in essence a different version (different in scope of tests) of the existing pipeline, right? Perhaps I’m missing something.

I certainly see the point in being intentional about documenting breaking changes better for users. In part @kevinrobinson ’s PR will help with that since we get a dedicated place to document how to upgrade from version to version.

That along with versioned docs should go a long way. I’m not opposed to further checks in principle, but they may be better off not being PR checks.","2020-06-13 00:24:32","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/472#issuecomment-643530639"

Imagine we find a bug in a method and fix it, which also changes the output of the method and hence the need to change the tests. Then as a result of your `FIX` your `main`/`master` branch is not backward compatible. This happens quite frequently in my experience and this alone is enough for me not to require full backward compatibility of the `main` branch with the latest release. And if such a fix goes to the `x.y.z+1` release, then those relevant tests are not gonna pass on `x.y.z` and that's intentional and okay.

If there's a way to show this in an example scenario or notebook, that'd be amazing.

re: fairness.html, I've shared some feedback on the fairness.html example already over in https://github.com/koaning/scikit-fairness/issues/31, and a specific critique https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues/430#issuecomment-632690069, but to recap: if you are trying to predict the median house price in a census tract, I don't understand why you would want to enforce that those predictions are uncorrelated with information about the income of people living in that census tract.  It seems like this is what the [Demographic Parity Classifier](https://scikit-lego.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fairness.html#Demographic-Parity-Classifier) and [Equal Opportunity](https://scikit-lego.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fairness.html#Equal-opportunity) examples are doing, so I'd love to understand more about why someone would use this technique, or about how this would mitigate any real harms.

Alternately, if the idea is that the task is similar to what the Boston dataset is used for in the original [Harrison and Rubinfeld work](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/22636/0000186.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y), it's harder for me to understand or interpret.  The original paper is not using this dataset to do a prediction task - the point of the hedonic pricing methodology in the paper is to learn the relationships between the features they have chosen and the median housing price in that tract.  They then use the weights of that model to understand the relative influence of the ""clean air"" feature, and how much it contributes to the median housing price which they know as ground truth.  So in that context I'm trying to understand the rationale for applying mitigation techniques to the predictions, since their methodology doesn't involve using the dataset to make predictions.

To try to help brainstorm another idea, I noticed that the Zafar paper runs its experiments on the UCI adult income dataset, and a ""bank dataset.""  Perhaps it might be helpful to explore if the original paper has example tasks that can show the value of these approaches?  While the URL in the paper to the bank dataset is broken, at first glance it seems like it refers to [a scenario](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) where a bank is trying to predict the success of a telemarking phone call campaign to get people to purchase 'term deposits' like bonds.  The paper discretizes age to ""between 25 and 60 or not"" and then shows the technique applied to a binary classifier.  I'm happy to help brainstorm but unfortunately it's also hard for me to understand how enforcing demographic parity on predictions about the success of a telemarketing campaign contributes to mitigating real harms.  I also don't understand paper's references to ""disparate impact"" in the context of marketing campaigns (eg, the company is deciding how many times to call each person and each row in the ""bank dataset"" encodes the bank's salespeople's decisions about how many times to call that home).  EDIT: Here's the references to the two papers on the UCI site for the ""bank dataset"": [A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing (Moro et al. 2014](http://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/30994/1/dss-v3.pdf) and [Using Data Mining for Bank Direct Marketing: An Application of the CRISP-DM Methodology (Moro et al. 2014)](https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/14838/1/MoroCortezLaureano_DMApproach4DirectMKT.pdf).  In the second paper, they also describe how they are not using the dataset to train a model for prediction:

> The business goal is to find a model that can explain success of a contact, i.e. if the   client   subscribes   the   deposit.   Such   model can increase campaign efficiency by identifying the   main characteristics that affect success, helping in a better management of the available resources (e.g. human effort, phone  calls,  time) and selection of a high quality and affordable set of potential buying customers.

Basically the current algorithm is a logistic regression with a constraint on the covariance between the predicted probabilities and the sensitive attributes, that is *a* way of imposing demographic parity, but I'm pretty sure there can be others as well. You easily run the risk of creating god objects and code that is not open/closed. I just took a quick look at the `ThresholdOptimizer` and the presence of a function named ` _threshold_optimization_demographic_parity` confirms this fear.

@kevinrobinson Agreed on the point regarding the dataset in the notebook I linked. Other datasets seem much more suitable.

I see that post, and am guessing the dataset is the same as the one with the same number of records [included in R](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/carData/versions/3.0-3/topics/Arrests)?  The R docs say that it's from police records in Toronto, filtered to only include arrests made for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and it doesn't disclose when or how it was collected.

I think it's important to say that predictive policing has been the subject of extensive work by many people, so it'd be amazing to connect the assessment and mitigation techniques here with that work!  If it's helpful, I think these two papers might be the most directly relevant to what you're doing here [An algorithm for removing sensitive information: application to race-independent recidivism prediction (Johndrow and Lum 2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04957.pdf) and [To predict and serve? (Lum and Isaac 2016)](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2016.00960.x) is shorter and more narrative.  In particular, they discuss why the sociotechnical context around the collection of the dataset is critical in evaluating algorithmic fairness mitigation techniques because of particular forms of observation bias and feedback loops in policing patterns.

FWIW, racial bias in policing is the subject of particular attention and discussion at this moment, at least in the US.  So potential users and audiences for fairlearn may be even more attuned to evaluating any algorithmic approaches that aim to reduce harm in predictive policing systems in a wider sociotechnical context.","2020-06-08 20:18:37","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/466#issuecomment-640863498"

Just to quickly address this fear: there's a PR by @MiroDudik out right now that generalizes this so that these things aren't specific under the hood. I don't know to what extent this is possible but can you imagine extending it to other constraints (say, true positive parity) in the future? I have yet to read the paper, so I can't say right now. If this is something we're interested in, then perhaps the ""god object"" as you call it isn't the worst idea. The APIs in the repo so far are written in a way where you specify the constraint as an argument in the constructor, so these would be the first ones that have it in the name.
I'm curious what you think about this.

I think @riedgar-ms referred to the general name when he wondered whether there's perhaps something better. For example, you could call any classifier that optimizes for Demographic Parity `DemographicParityClassifier`, but it really should be descriptive of the technique that's used.

As you say, the Demographic Parity follows

Your Equal Opportunity implementation actually follows another approach by Zafar et al:

* linear_model CONS:
  * it is possible to mitigate unfairness in logistic regression via reductions or postprocessing or preprocessing, so I don't think that we necessarily what the users to go instinctively to `fairlearn.linear_model` for these needs (?)
  * I don't think that we should try to have a mitigated variant for all estimators in `sklearn.linear_model` 
* inprocessing PROS:
  * for better or worse, the `inprocessing` is now a terminology accepted in parts of the fair ML community, e.g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.09635.pdf and https://aif360.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/algorithms.html#module-aif360.algorithms.inprocessing

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","650564824","A quick update: I have taken an informal poll among a few fair ML / data mining researchers, and folks raised several additional issues with in-processing (for example, it sounds like data transformation rather than training and so it is confusing--also, it is not as widely adopted as I thought), so I no longer think that we should consider it as a module name. So let's stick to **fairlearn.linear_model**.

We just need to settle the calling API. Let's first figure out how to handle specification of constraints. Let me repeat my two suggestions from above and add a third one:

```
class ConstrainedLogisticRegression(BaseEstimator, LinearClassifierMixin):
    def __init__(self, constraints='demographic_parity', *, covariance_bound=0.0, ...)

class ConstrainedLogisticRegression(BaseEstimator, LinearClassifierMixin):
    def __init__(self, *, constraints='demographic_parity', covariance_bound=0.0, ...)

class LogisticRegression(BaseEstimator, LinearClassifierMixin):
    def __init__(self, *, constraints=None, covariance_bound=0.0, ...)
```
The idea is that `constraints=None` would just revert to the unconstrained behavior. I think that your current implementation has the default corresponding to `covariance_bound=np.inf`--I think it's a bit counter-intuitive, but open to discussion.

- `DemographicParity` compares each individual group's selection rate to the overall selection rate, whereas demographic parity difference looks at min vs. max. This isn't document well and actually came up a few times already. Perhaps this isn't intuitive @MiroDudik 

- Ran this myself and got a warning in trial one `The pivot operation produces a pivot value of: 1.6e-06, which is only slightly greater than the specified tolerance 1.0e-09. This may lead to issues regarding the numerical stability of the simplex method. Removing redundant constraints, changing the pivot strategy via Bland's rule or increasing the tolerance may help reduce the issue.`

- Ran this with a few additional trials and the numbers are always around the same as yours, so it's not just that you had bad luck. For completeness:

Note: I had to modify the used metrics. Instead of `accuracy_score` I used `1 - mean_absolute_error` and `selection_rate` had to be modified to work with the floating point numbers as well (in a hacky way for this example as `sum(np.squeeze(np.asarray(y_pred))) / len(y_pred)`.

So, we should definitely modify our quick start example! Thanks for catching this.

Overall, we should spell out in the documentation that just like regular classifiers can overfit, so can the mitigated classifiers and that hyperparameters should be tuned to prevent overfitting. As a strategy, we should suggest to tune hyperparameters on the ""regular"" classifier and then apply the same hyperparameters when running `ExponentiatedGradient`.","2020-06-15 16:42:34","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/460#issuecomment-644245257"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","645045607","This is awesomely helpful, thanks!  I'll leave aside improvements to the quickstart, and try to focus on the conceptual questions so I can understand enough to roll this into a user guide.

First, I get that if the mitigation algorithm is given an overfit classifier, its predictions will be overfit and them mitigation algorithm will violate the bounds of the constraints.  This fundamentally happens because of the difference between the training and test sets.  But this surprised me, I think because I've made inaccurate assumptions about the ""constraints"" and ""guarantees"" that are provided.  My understanding is that if the training and test set are not drawn from the same distribution, there are no theoretical bounds on any of `fairlearn`'s constraints.  Perhaps this is obvious to everyone else, but this seems like it has practical implications that would be worth teaching users about :)

Second, I was wondering what an experiment might look like to probe at this.  I'll share this as a thought experiment first.  Imagine:
1. we made binary classifier that was perfect 95% of the time and random 5% of the time
2. we had a training dataset and a test dataset drawn from the same distribution
3. we ran a `ExponentiatedGradient` for `DemographicParity` on the messed up binary classifier from step 1
4. we looked at the predictions of the mitigated classifier on the test dataset

Would we be able to characterize the bounds of how much the `DemographicParity` constraint is violated on the test dataset, across all trials?  In other words, even if a toy scenario where we can control the error in the classifier, and the distribution drift between training and test, could we characterize the error bounds of `ExponentiatedGradient`?  Perhaps it's better to just make this example, and happy to do that if it'd be a more helpful next step!  I also recognize that if I more deeply understood the implementation code I would be able to explain this better, so if you all think it's helpful for me to go off and understand some particular piece of that, that could be a helpful next step too. 👍 ","2020-06-16 22:33:27","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/460#issuecomment-645045607"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","645054322","@kevinrobinson I just submitted a PR to update the quickstart to avoid overfitting as described by Miro. That doesn't solve everything, obviously.

The guarantees only apply to the training set. The constraints will not hold on the test set, so a small difference is always expected. Furthermore, this is a randomized predictor as explained above. For more on that I recommend taking a look at the API reference https://fairlearn.github.io/api_reference/fairlearn.reductions.html#fairlearn.reductions.ExponentiatedGradient.predict as well as the paper's section on randomization (where they introduce `Q`).

We absolutely need to address that in the documentation. As you noticed there are currently two efforts by Richard and me to write documentation around basics of reductions approaches, and we should build on those PRs with this kind of info.

Regarding your thought experiment: Are you assuming that the ""random 5%"" are randomly picked once and from there on out consistent? I'm pretty sure Exponentiated Gradient assumes that the underlying estimators are deterministic.","2020-06-16 23:03:16","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/460#issuecomment-645054322"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","647808933","The root of this issue still isn't addressed despite the correction in the Quickstart, of course!

One way to address it would be to have a notebook that illustrates generalization (or lack thereof) by taking something like this example (below is just a suggestion of what could be in that, not strictly the agenda):

1. overfit an estimator and see how Fairlearn's mitigation will overfit
2. add regularization (or other means) to avoid overfitting, and observe that Fairlearn's mitigation won't overfit either
3. discuss when fairness constraints are expected to hold, i.e., on the training set and if the test set follows the same distribution we expect to be reasonably close as well. This will probably also require mentioning randomized classifiers since that can affect results to some extent.

I'm not sure but I think the reworked metrics API will actually pass that through to the underlying method. Having said that, the fact that you're asking about it means that (even if it would be passed through) it's not documented properly.

The point about a privileged group is an interesting one. Our metrics are always based on max and min, rather than a particular group. But different groups could get the max and min by different metrics. We probably need to support both - i.e. if `privileged_group=None` then do what we do now, and base on max and min. Otherwise, compare to the specified group (and concoct some way of handling the case where the privileged group might not be the max or min - easy for differences, ratios are not so obvious).","2020-06-04 14:35:18","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/458#issuecomment-638888980"

There's indeed a lot to be improved in terms of the documentation. Ideally our documentation (API reference) should be clear enough that people understand what they're actually calling. Providing a string ""explanation"" is a pattern I haven't seen before, but if it's something people find useful we should consider it. As a user I usually don't use things unless I have an idea of what it does, which is why from my perspective the documentation improvements sound like the obvious place to fix this.

I agree that it gets difficult with the metrics when comparing more than two groups. That's pretty much the value proposition of the dashboard single model view. Beyond that, I couldn't agree more that a single metric (e.g. min/max difference) isn't sufficient. I hope the documentation doesn't say that anywhere. We should always take a look at the entire picture, but that's hard with just numbers and that's where the visualizations come in.

The group summaries do provide you with everything you need to make any sort of comparisons, though, in case you really want to do this without visualizations
```python
>>> from fairlearn.metrics import accuracy_score_group_summary
>>> y_true = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
>>> y_pred = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
>>> sensitive_features = [""a"", ""b"", ""b"", ""a"", ""a"", ""a"", ""b"", ""b"", ""a"", ""b"", ""b"", ""b"", ""a"", ""b""]
>>> accuracy_score_group_summary(y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features=sensitive_features)
{'overall': 0.7142857142857143, 'by_group': {'a': 0.8333333333333334, 'b': 0.625}}
```

Even if there are more groups you could always figure out specific differences between certain groups that are relevant to your context.

In terms of follow-ups I think it makes sense to iterate on the documentation and user guide. There's currently a PR out #451 that adds content to the user guide for metrics. That may help as a first step, but I don't see this as the final piece. @hildeweerts thanks again for raising this. It's really helpful to hear what is hard to understand, what you would have expected to see, etc. 

If you have a concrete suggestion please also feel free to submit a PR. We're happy to take any contributions!","2020-06-04 17:20:50","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/458#issuecomment-638992673"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","639016481","As I think a bit more, we would probably want to have users select the group via a `selected_group` argument, rather than `privileged_group` since they may be wanting to view comparisons with a group which is getting particular bad results, rather than the best ones.

Other than that, I think that for the metrics code, our first order of business should be to:

- Ensure that `pos_value` is supported by all the classification metrics
- Add the `selected_group` argument for all metrics, and decide on a consistent way of handling differences and ratios in that case

Would that cover your main concerns there @hildeweerts ? I very much agree that we need to have the documentation make it plain that 'fairness isn't just a single number.' I'm a little more leery of trying to generate explanatory text from these. I can see that there is value in that, but it's also a lot of effort, given all the potential little edge cases.

As a user I usually don't use things unless I have an idea of what it does, which is why from my perspective the documentation improvements sound like the obvious place to fix this.

Yes, improving documentation would help. Nevertheless, even if you do know what you're calling it is very easy to make mistakes, especially in an exploratory phase, e.g. because you accidentally switched labels or something like that. I don't think textual explanations are necessarily the way to go, as @riedgar-ms mentioned there are many potential edge cases, but I do think it is something we need to think about.

> I agree that it gets difficult with the metrics when comparing more than two groups. That's pretty much the value proposition of the dashboard single model view. 

Using the dashboard is a nice way to circumvent these issues, but there are also many use cases in which the dashboard may not be sufficient or desirable. I wonder whether returning a single number should be the default behavior at all. I can also imagine returning the summary as default behavior while adding specific function arguments for aggregations. At least in this scenario, users would be forced to consciously think about what they are optimizing for.

> Ensure that pos_value is supported by all the classification metrics

Yes! It might already be supported for most if not all - so this would probably mostly be a documentation issue.","2020-06-05 10:42:34","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/458#issuecomment-639401168"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","639609533","These are my suggestions for next steps:
* improve documentation on when to use which metrics; we in fact have a more basic concern, which is to even expose the metrics that are already available (because they are hidden inside the metrics dictionaries right now)
* add `pos_label` to our own base metrics and make sure that it works with the metrics that we derive from `sklearn.metrics`
* in documentation, we should point out strongly that the aggregate metrics are just the initial diagnostic step and if you see that their value is large, you'll want to dig into the distribution of the base metric across the groups and so you should use `<metric>_group_summary`.
  * This was the rationale behind defining the worst-case versions of difference & ratio--they are meant to quantify the overall disparity rather than a disadvantage of a specific group. Thinking about disadvantage requires more nuance, so I'd much rather show the numbers across all groups and let that serve as a starting point for further exploration. 

I'm right now a bit less sure about the benefit of creating an additional functionality around `selected_group` or `privileged_group` as opposed to just using `<metric>_group_summary`.

But at least some quick arguments that we went through. Parity is a constraint (or a set of constraints), so the metrics should not be called ""parity"". One idea would be to call the metric ""disparity"", so we'd have `demographic_disparity(..., metric='difference')` or something like that. This might be okay, but it becomes verbose when generalizing to things like true positive rate, when we'd end up with `true_positive_rate_disparity(..., metric='ratio')` and we'd probably have a default `metric='difference'`. So we opted for `true_positive_rate_difference` and `true_positive_rate_ratio` instead--it makes clearer what you're measuring (rather than rely on the default) and is less verbose.","2020-06-05 16:46:58","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/457#issuecomment-639623501"

threshold is 0.05
selection rate of A is 0.75
selection rate of B is 0.81

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","636158991","@MiroDudik  can certainly provide more details, but a few things ahead:

- Let's call the repo/project Fairlearn, not the algorithm. Fairlearn contains other algorithms, not just the one(s) from the original paper.
- The algorithm they refer to from the Agarwal et al. paper is called `ExponentiatedGradient` in this repo, and the ""deterministic"" one is called `GridSearch`.

So picking `n` is something you do for `GridSearch`, but not for `ExponentiatedGradient`.

The dashboard is not tied to any mitigation techniques. You could use it in a standalone fashion, just analyzing metrics of a model. If you provide data from multiple models it will provide you a comparison view (but you can still drill down into the single model view). None of this requires any sort of mitigation, but some of our examples try to showcase how to use grid search output with the dashboard.

Taking a step back now: there are advantages and disadvantages to every mitigation technique. Fairlearn doesn't necessarily need to push people towards one approach over the other. It would be great if we can provide all tools that people care about, and along with that the educational material to help them decide what makes sense in their particular situation. As mentioned above there are plenty of situations where mitigation may not be required at all. So purely from a project scope standpoint I would say that it would be great to have this as part of the toolbox.

... but when I last tried using it it was rather cumbersome (as you'd expect from research code), and it took months to hear back on the technical difficulties. That said, if there's interest from users I don't see why we couldn't put in the effort to integrate it into Fairlearn. Adding tensorflow as a requirement isn't lightweight at all, but there are certain workarounds like adding it as an extension (similar to what we do with matplotlib right now).
To this day I haven't heard anyone complaining about the lack of mitigation techniques, though, so that's all speculation at this point.","2020-05-29 19:53:56","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/439#issuecomment-636158991"

...this is really what I'm trying to understand better, so thanks!  I'm happy to help package this discussion up into docs if that's helpful after. :)

So first, to check my understanding, `ExponentiatedGradient` code is:

> We proceed iteratively by running a no-regret algorithm for the λ-player, while executing the best response of the Q-player. Following Freund & Schapire (1996), the average play of both players converges to the saddle point. We run the exponentiated gradient algorithm (Kivinen & Warmuth,1997) for the λ-player and terminate as soon as the sub optimality of the average play falls below the pre-specified accuracy ν.

I think I see this all in https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/blob/master/fairlearn/reductions/_exponentiated_gradient/exponentiated_gradient.py#L153.  (EDIT: I moved the questions about understanding the signficance of the `ν` param into https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues/444, which looks at this in the specific scenario in the quickstart).

Second, I'm trying to understand when I'd want to use this approach versus the grid search.  For example, in the [credit card example](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/blob/master/notebooks/Grid%20Search%20for%20Binary%20Classification.ipynb), why does it make more sense to use the `GridSearch` versus just using the `ExponentiatedGradient` method?

It's probably good to cut back down the scope to focusing on the different algorithmic approaches and contexts where they'd make more or less sense (vs other ecosystem/community questions), since I've asked too many questions here. :)","2020-05-29 20:36:54","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/439#issuecomment-636181099"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","636548963","It's absolutely helpful to document this. Feel free to submit PRs as you see fit! :-)

Not sure if I see a question before ""Second"", but yes, the exponentiated_gradient.py file has the logic from the paper. You may also have noticed some logic related to a linear program (in the code `LP` or `linprog` depending on where you look) which is not mentioned in the paper. It's an optimization @MiroDudik added.

`GridSearch` vs `ExponentiatedGradient` is an interesting comparison! One could think of `GridSearch` as the naive or brute force version of `ExponentiatedGradient`. That has certain limits, though. If you have a binary sensitive feature, you effectively end up with a 1-dimensional grid (if you want to call that a grid at all...). Searching that is not too hard. Once your sensitive features get more values or you consider intersectionality the grid dimensionality explodes pretty quickly. [Sidenote: as you're aware intersectionality should certainly be on people's radar]
At each grid point we end up having to fit our estimator. Let's say we have a 10-dimensional grid. To cover this adequately we'd need a lot of grid points, or we may end up not finding a very good solution. `ExponentiatedGradient` approaches this different by iteratively and intelligently picking the next solution until we either get below our tolerance or hit the iteration limit. The paper provides certain theoretical guarantees so as long as your iteration limit is high enough you'll find a solution that suits your requirements.

Taking a step back: this and a lot more should be explained in the [user guide](https://fairlearn.github.io/user_guide/mitigation.html#reductions), perhaps with examples to illustrate. It's something we're working towards. As you've noticed the documentation is lacking on various fronts, so I can't quite say when this gets better. If you feel like improving any part don't feel shy to do so. Thanks!  ","2020-05-31 23:44:40","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/439#issuecomment-636548963"

* The high level idea behind Algorithm 1 is the same as our `fairlearn.reductions.ExponentiatedGradient`--they solve the same basic optimization problem. We have implemented some additional tweaks that improve the performance:
  * We use exponentiated gradient instead of projected (sub)gradient. I did some initial benchmarking when writing our paper, and exponentiated gradient seemed to work better, so that's what we have implemented.
  * We check for the duality gap, which allows us to terminate early, as soon as we solve the optimization problem.
  * We carry out the _shrinkage step_ from their paper in each iteration (we call in `LP_step`). This is computationally very cheap, but practically very important, because it allows us to solve the problem in around 10 iterations rather than something like 100 or more--which is how long it would take without it (or if you only used it for sparsification at the very end as they suggest).

The key assumption that Algorithm 1 and ExponentiatedGradient make is that the underlying supervised learner (aka ""oracle"" aka ""base estimator"") can solve some hard problems. That's a similar leap of faith that data scientists make when they run _any_ classification algorithm (0/1 classification is NP-hard). In ExponentiatedGradient, we take some additional heuristical steps ([here](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/blob/fee71c194e5fbc08d2d17f431d30788752adba5c/fairlearn/reductions/_exponentiated_gradient/_lagrangian.py#L101) and [here](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/blob/fee71c194e5fbc08d2d17f431d30788752adba5c/fairlearn/reductions/_exponentiated_gradient/_lagrangian.py#L173)) to ""encourage"" the oracle to solve these hard problems, but sometimes the oracle might fail. In that case, ExponentiatedGradient might not reduce the duality gap as fast as implied by theory. A more typical consequence is that the calculated duality gap is small, but incorrect, and so the optimality guarantee would not hold. I have observed this behavior in ExponentiatedGradient in situations when the fairness constraints are harder to satisfy--e.g., when `eps` is close to zero. This is the failure that Cotter et al. are trying to address.

* Their Algorithms 2, 3 and 4 introduce the idea of proxy-Lagrangian.
  * This can be advantageous if you are wrapping a supervised learner (i.e., ""reducing to an oracle"") that can solve for arbitrary differentiable objectives--for example, if your are trying to fit a neural net in tensorflow. ExponentiatedGradient can still be applied, but it does not exploit the differentiability structure and so the problems that it is creating for the underlying supervised learner might be harder.
  * Algorithms 2-4 do not reduce to supervised learning, but to _optimization_. This means that you cannot for example easily specify them as ""wrappers"" (or meta-estimators in the sklearn terminology). Also, I don't think they would easily work with classifiers that are not based on optimization--like decision trees or tree ensembles.
  * Algorithm 2 still creates NP-hard subproblems (that are passed to the oracle), but because the problems it creates are differentiable, they might be easier than those created by ExponentiatedGradient. The price that it pays is that its optimality guarantees are weaker than those enjoyed by Algorithm 1 and ExponentiatedGradient. Specifically: note that Eq. 16 has _g&#771;<sub>i</sub>_ in the `inf` whereas the matching expression in Theorem 2 has _g<sub>i</sub>_. That said--it's not clear to me that this distinction matters in practice.
  * Algorithm 3 does not create hard problems, but its scope is more limited, because it assumes that the surrogates are convex--in that case Eq. 16 might bite quite unpleasantly. You could possibly run this algorithm without convexity and it might work in practice, but guarantees don't hold.
  * Algorithm 4 is a heuristic without guarantees, but it might work reasonably well in practice.

So--what's the practitioner to do?

* If the underlying supervised oracle (base estimator) is not optimization based--e.g., when it is fitting a decision tree or an ensemble of trees--then it is not really possible to run Algorithms 2-4.

* If you have access to an optimizer--e.g., you are training something that can be written as a (differentiable) neural net--it makes sense to try one of Algorithms 2-4. In particular, Algorithm 4 seems to do well empirically (although it does not come with guarantees). Besides creating differentiable subproblems it has an additional advantage over ExponentiatedGradient: it does not require solving the subproblems to full precision, and so it can be much faster. But that also opens a can of worms--since you need to tune the learning rate, mini-batch size etc.. So I would still suggest running ExponentiatedGradient at least once (using the hyperparameters that work for the unconstrained version of the problem). And only then embark on Algorithm 4.

I also am thankful for the bit translating this into a practitioner perspective too :)

One quick reaction I have is that there is a lot of complexity to understand how the theoretical work in any of these approaches will apply to any specific problem or scenario. :) So while the 2018 paper says things like:

> Our reductions work for any classifier representation, encompass many definitions of fairness, **satisfy provable guarantees**, and work well in practice.

I think I might have interpreted what terms like 'constraints' and 'guarantees' meant a bit too naively or rigidly.  So this is super helpful in realizing I need to understand this more deeply. 👍 

I'll dig into reading through this more to make sure I'm fully understanding, and although it might take some more questions and clarifications, I'd love to help translate this discussion into user-facing documentation or an example notebook illustrating what you're describing in a particular scenario.","2020-06-05 21:44:26","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/439#issuecomment-639838591"

I'm not super opinionated about this and like your PR and suggestions to have datasets in Fairlearn. The only concern is around ownership. Would hate to violate terms of the dataset owner. I tried adding another dataset with the same blueprint you provided, @koaning , and that worked really well. I can add all fairness-related ones we have in `tempeh`, and perhaps that makes the entire package somewhat redundant. In that case I'm happy to get rid of it.

For example, would it help if we just kept the copyright notice in the LICENSE file? On a basic level, I'm not sure whether we should be preventing any contributor (e.g., folks from Google, Facebook, or any other corporations) for stating their copyright as long as they keep the MIT license.

I think that we're running into a misconception--but a turnoff nevertheless. The way I understand this, in case of the MIT license, the copyright notice is like stating the authorship and so when somebody copies substantial portions of the code, they need to give credit to the author (just by stating their names as given in the copyright notice). Other than that--everybody is free to do as they please with the code. When you update the code, you become a co-author and you can add your name in the form of the copyright notice at the top.

I agree with everything written above. It’s altogether not unusual to have companies holding copyrights, e.g. [angular](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/LICENSE) or [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/LICENSE). That said, I had the same impression as you. One pattern I found that I like is “copyright X and other contributors” , e.g. [JQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) or [Vowpal Wabbit](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/blob/master/LICENSE). I’ve been trying to get some clarity from folks with more experience in open source licensing to make sure I am allowed to extend copyright to “all contributors” but with MIT license it really shouldn’t matter as Miro wrote. Nevertheless, giving the strange first impression doesn’t do any good either. I’ll push a little harder to get a resolution internally and will update this thread. 

Regarding the lines in every file: you may recall that we’re thinking of the license for documentation (perhaps CC BY) as something different from the license for code (MIT). For clarity it may be beneficial to have it explicitly stated. That’s another point I want to get a definitive answer on, though.

Adding @MiroDudik and @hannawallach as well. I think it's interesting, but we need to be very careful in the description / documentation. De-biasing data is usually a tricky topic since there are so many different kinds, and they can affect each other etc., so the way we've been looking at it so far is described in the [documentation](https://fairlearn.github.io/user_guide/fairness_in_machine_learning.html) (quoted below). That's much more focused on ""harms"", that is looking at the outcome or result.
That said, applying this could reduce the unfairness in the outcome at the end of the pipeline. We've discussed adding preprocessing techniques a few times, but never quite got down to it. I think it would be great to add it. 


> AI systems can behave unfairly for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it is because of societal biases reflected in the training data and in the decisions made during the development and deployment of these systems. In other cases, AI systems behave unfairly not because of societal biases, but because of characteristics of the data (e.g., too few data points about some group of people) or characteristics of the systems themselves. It can be hard to distinguish between these reasons, especially since they are not mutually exclusive and often exacerbate one another. Therefore, we define whether an AI system is behaving unfairly in terms of its impact on people — i.e., in terms of harms — and not in terms of specific causes, such as societal biases, or in terms of intent, such as prejudice.
Usage of the word bias. Since we define fairness in terms of harms rather than specific causes (such as societal biases), we avoid the usage of the words bias or debiasing in describing the functionality of Fairlearn.","2020-05-21 18:01:38","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/430#issuecomment-632256459"

We've chatted a bit about the Boston housing dataset in and of itself, but with regards to `InformationFilter` specifically I can't really follow why you would apply it in that scenario.  For example, if someone wants to predict median home value in a geographic area, why would they want to enforce that those predictions about real estate price are not correlated with incomes for that geographic area?  I'm also trying to understand how using `InformationFilter` to remove information about racial demographics in a geographic area connects with assessing or mitigating real-world harms related to housing.  Finding another scenario might just be all we need :)

@koaning it sounds like there might be other real world contexts where you have used this approach?

If one would use this dataset to automate house price prediction. If a low income neighborhood is getting gentrifed then this model may cause low income households to get less money for their house because they’re stamped as low-income.

Your `InformationFilter` reminds me of [Impartial predictive modeling: Ensuring fairness in arbitrary models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.00528.pdf). Their approach in Definition 4 is equivalent to applying `InformationFilter` at training time, but then using the original features at the test time (without the sensitive features partialed out).

But I think that the way you [quantify fairness](https://scikit-fairness.netlify.app/fairness_boston_housing.html#Measuring-fairness-for-Regression) in your example is more like [Controlling Attribute Effect in Linear Regression](http://web.lums.edu.pk/~akarim/pub/controlling_attribute_effect_icdm2013.pdf). I think that you'd like to ensure, at least for (generalized) linear models, that the model prediction is uncorrelated with sensitive features, right? But if that's what you want then I think that you need to subtract feature means before doing Gram-Schmidt.

Did I get this right or is there something else that you had in mind to achieve with `InformationFilter`?","2020-05-23 14:36:53","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/430#issuecomment-633066434"

It may very well be that there's a paper with this idea in mind and I wouldn't mind linking to related works, but this implementation is not based on a paper. I think it was just a whiteboard session I had with @Mbrouns.

You could certainly standardise with a `StandardScaler` or a `QuantileScaler` before passing data to the `InformationFilter` (this is often a good idea even without thinking about fairness) but even without it we've been able to see that it indeed removes correlation with sensitive attributes.

I would argue here that the way one might prefer to quantify fairness is indepedant of the methods one might apply. It may be that there's tools that specialize towards a certain fairness metric but the algorithm designer can (and should) varify emperically if their preferred fairness measure gives good scores when the information filter, or any tool for fairness, is used.","2020-05-27 10:03:45","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/430#issuecomment-634560076"

I generally like the idea and I think it would be a nice addition, but I think that the centering step should be always done.

One example to think about is:
* feature1 = [0, 0, 1, 1]
* feature2 = [1, 1, 2, 2]

If feature1 is sensitive, then using just Gram-Schimdt without recentering will give you
* feature2' = [1, 1, 0, 0]

That seems undesirable. If you center first, then you'll get feature2'= [0, 0, 0, 0].","2020-05-29 04:02:17","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/430#issuecomment-635744874"

That's fair, but as @koaning mentioned, s scaler can be applied in the pipeline before this step. We should just document that the data is expected to be centered. You could also raise a warning if the input data deviates too much from what `InformationFilter` expects. It's usually much cleaner and nicer if the preprocessing needed for a step is not done in the step itself.","2020-05-29 09:53:16","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/430#issuecomment-635884478"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","635977124","In principle I am okay with raising a warning, I just want to make sure that the absence of centering is a feature not a bug :-). That's why I wanted more clarity about the intended behavior--the intended behavior should be described as a relationship between input and output rather than as a procedure.

If I understand this correctly, fairness here is formalized as statistical independence--the initial goal is to obtain transformed features that are statistically independent from the sensitive features, while keeping as much information as possible otherwise. If such a thing was possible, then any classifier / regressor based on the transformed features would also be statistically independent of the sensitive features.

Instead of going after this in full generality, one could simply require that the transformed features are uncorrelated with the sensitive features. In symbols, if `x_i` is the original feature vector of the i-th example and `s_i` is a vector of sensitive features of the i-th examples (these would be rows in a data frame, but I'm thinking of them as columns), the goal is to derive transformed feature vectors `z_i` such that:

* `E[z s^T] = E[z] E[s]^T`,
   meaning
   ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac1n%20%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En%20z_i%20s_i%5ET%20%3D%20%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac1n%20%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En%20z_i%5Cright%29%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac1n%20%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En%20s_i%5Cright%29%5ET)
   in words: every component of `z_i` is uncorrelated with every component of `s_i`

That requires centering + Gram-Schmidt. And without centering you only achieve

* `E[z s^T] = 0`
   I'm not sure how this achieves independence in the absence of centering

I cannot easily think of any use case where one would use Gram-Schmidt without centering.

The pattern of seemingly combining two steps into one already exists in `sklearn`. In fact `StandardScaler` is doing two things--it is centering and re-scaling by default, and you can disable either of the two aspects if you like. I'd much rather follow a similar pattern here, where we center by default, and you can disable it.

**Update:** I think that when the data matrix is sparse, you want to avoid explicit centering. However, in that case, I still think that it might be a good idea to do implicit centering. In this case, if `x` and `s` are two columns of data matrix; `s` being the sensitive feature and `x` being another feature, you would derived the transformed feature column `z` using the formula:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?z%20%3D%20x%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cfrac1n%20x%5ET%20s%20-%20%5Cbar%7Bx%7D%5Cbar%7Bs%7D%7D%7B%5Cfrac1n%20s%5ET%20s%20-%20%5Cbar%7Bs%7D%5Cbar%7Bs%7D%7D%5Ccdot%20s)

where `\bar{x}` and `\bar{s}` are the scalars corresponding to the averages of `x` and `s`. I think that I would be okay if we skipped explicit centering (or created a flag for it, with a default either way), but if we applied this modified Gram-Schmidt formula. This modified Gram-Schmidt will nicely deal with things like `x=[0,0,1,1], s=[1,1,0,0]`.

I just found a huge difference between the original `InformationFilter` that uses Gram-Smidt and the `CorrelationRemover` that uses regression internally. 

Each gif represents the model output. I am taking the boston dataset and applying a linear regression after filtering away information. I've made two gifs that each display three charts. 

1. The 1st chart shows predictions on the x-axis and true values on the y-axis. 
2. The 2nd chart shows predicted values split on a sensitive attribute `B`. I split the column into two groups, the group that has a value B < np.mean(B) and a group with a value B > np.mean(B). You would hope the resulting two histograms to overlap.
3. The 3rd chart shows predicted values split on a sensitive attribute `LSTAT`. I split the column into two groups, the group that has a value LSTAT < np.mean(LSTAT) and a group with a value LSTAT > np.mean(BLSTAT). You would hope the resulting two histograms to overlap.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1019791/85955992-ab5b5d00-b982-11ea-86ed-48a686243e03.png)

<details>
  <summary><b>More details on the chart.</b></summary>
  I'll give a code snippet as well to make it more clear what the y-value in this chart entails.

```
X, y = load_boston()
pred = pipeline(alpha).predict(X)
c12_upper, c12_lower = pred[X[:, 12] > X[:, 12].mean()], pred[X[:, 12] <= X[:, 12].mean()]
y = c12_upper.mean() - c12_upper.lower()
```

When y=0, I could argue we have a proxy for equal treatment between groups. 

</details>


It seems like the fact that the `CorrelationRemover` is trying to remove correlation by changeing the original data as little as possible is making it less aggressive and in this benchmark ... it seems like the earlier approach was preferable.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","700984593","There were two bugs in the notebook. One of them was in the implementation of `CorrelationRemover.fit()`:
* _original_: `self.sensitive_mean_ = X_sensitive.mean()`
  _correct_: `self.sensitive_mean_ = X_sensitive.mean(axis=0)`

The second was in `run_stat()` implementation on **adult**:
* _original_:
```python
    pipe = Pipeline([
        ('filter', filt([0, 1], alpha=alpha)),
        ('mod', alg)
    ])
```
* _correct_:
```python
    pipe = Pipeline([
        ('filter', filt([1, 2], alpha=alpha)),
        ('mod', alg)
    ])
```

With those two bugs fixed, some of the paradoxes that we saw previously disappear. To generate the plots below, I was running [this notebook](https://gist.github.com/MiroDudik/0eb70f05631fb0c240cf3aa29c7d1576).

Besides the disparity metrics that you measured previously, I'm also measuring a rescaled version of covariance (scaled to be comparable to the difference stats). Similarly to the difference stats, covariance=0 here corresponds to greater fairness:

### Boston dataset
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20565444/94611075-38a69a00-026f-11eb-9f72-1b2f0630d55e.png)

Linear models (linear regression and logistic regression) behave as expected: `CorrelationRemover` leads to the greatest fairness with alpha close to 1. On the other hand, behavior of `InformationRemover` is less consistent across the two linear models and it does not achieve the same low values of unfairness.

I'm not quite sure what to say about non-linear models except that neither of the two mitigation techniques does particularly well, except for SVR, which appears more similar to a linear model than to the k-nearest neighbors model (but that could be driven by the default choice of hyperparameters).

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","701428787","Ah yeah. Good catch there. Covariance is also a nice touch. 

I've confirmed these results locally and they convince me to focus on the `CorrelationRemover` part. It's faster, numerically more stable and currently I can't come up with edge cases where the `InformationFilter` approach will be better. If we agree that this `CorrelationRemover` is an appropriate addition I wouldn't mind preparing a PR. 

That said, some folks have been playing with the scikit-lego implementation of `InformationFilter` and it does demonstrate some [other drawbacks](https://twitter.com/davidmasip2/status/1290644405880324096). If the orignal dataset is already balanced, it seems like this method might make it ""unbalanced"" and it seems to ""hickup"" when there's integers around (as opposed to floats floats/categoricals). The method still seems valid, but the docs should reflect that it is to be applied in combination with linear systems and that feedback is perhaps appreciated.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","646468998","Thanks for the stimulating discussion today! I had noted down a few things that I'm generally unsure about in the context of credit card/loan/etc. application decisions. I'll just post them here for the next deep dive:

1. If people have little or no credit history, do they (or should they) be treated separately? I'm curious about this because it makes the entire fairness assessment a lot more tricky. Do you compare outcomes as a whole (looking at everyone) or outcomes per bucket (fairness for automatically evaluated cases, and fairness for separately/manually evaluated cases)? Perhaps both? All considerations seem relevant since the fairness of the system as a whole may be affected even if both individual parts provide some sort of parity, because the parity may not hold for the system as a whole.
   The distribution of people in the ""no credit history"" bucket may be very different from the rest as well. I'd expect lots of younger people and immigrants.

2. I'd expect the overall number of possible accepted applications to be restricted, because there's only so much money a financial institution can give away. How does this affect the problem formulation. If we use binary classification we'll get some percentage with 0s and some with 1s. We may be able to get scores or probabilities out of this depending on the technique of choice, so that would allow us to take the top-k and approve them to reach the desired lending amount. Perhaps that's not at all how financial institutions think, so this may be worth checking with practitioners.

3. I'm missing a discussion on why Equalized Odds is what we want to have, and why not other criteria. That's usually the hardest choice. http://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/projects/aequitas/ has a nice little chart on how to figure this out, although I don't know if such a chart should even exist. Also, how much deviation from exact parity are we willing to allow? Why?

4. Do we want to talk about how historically there are various factors that influence credit card approval decisions and that those may also be reflected in the data? Obviously this in itself is context-dependent, and would require some digging in literature that we're not really familiar with.

5. Beyond y/n decisions financial institutions have more knobs. One such method is to introduce thresholds above which there's auto-approval, and another one below which there's auto-rejection. In between there may be more manual scrutiny. This was mentioned on the call today. There are other conceivable options such as the perhaps approving an application, but with a lower credit limit. Are we simplifying this too much, or would that be a separate model that decides the credit limit? Again, probably worth checking with practitioners.

6. Selection bias: People who never got a credit card card wouldn't be able to establish any kind of history. This was raised today as well. This ties into point (4) because if historical discrimination causes people to be rejected even today then there's no way for Fairlearn's tools like mitigation to help. This may require special attention to ensure the resulting system doesn't repeat this behavior, but instead at the very least surfaces this in some way. Importantly, this also shouldn't result in too many extra hurdles because that may keep groups that were previously unrepresented in the dataset unrepresented even in the future, and having considerably higher burden to get approved is a harm in itself.

7. This is just additional context for ML in credit lending that I found interesting: https://towardsdatascience.com/my-analysis-from-50-papers-on-the-application-of-ml-in-credit-lending-b9b810a3f38. One of the takeaways is that interpretability is important which may restrict what estimator we can use. The Apple Card scenario serves as an interesting case study here as well. https://www.forbes.com/sites/maikoschaffrath/2019/11/12/with-apple-card-investigated-for-discrimination-can-tech-create-a-better-credit-system/#637131212a98

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","646650727","@romanlutz Yeah, this is amazing! 👍 These are exactly the kinds of questions that I'd hope an engineer or data scientist who cares about fairness might be asking, and I hope there are ways the project can help make this a place for that and even encourage it :)

I also think that this kind of work is different than shipping code, and that sometimes it feels challenging because it's so open-ended and complex.  I view this as similar to the work in finding ""product-market fit"" - it's building understanding and empathy of potential users, as a way to explore how or whether the project can contribute to those users.  If we can find an example where that feels good, then we can roll it into a more concise notebook scenario, and then that's directly useful for validating with potential users, making marketing copy, examples for documentation, etc.

And if we find there either isn't a real demand in that kind of deployment context, or the demand is for something that's different than core values around fairness as a sociotechnical challenge (eg, the real value is related to reducing regulatory risk, and it won't meaningfully influence real-world harms), then it's a signal to keep exploring other deployment contexts where the project might contribute.

That's just my two cents, thanks for sharing such thoughtful questions! 👍 ","2020-06-19 13:56:30","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/418#issuecomment-646650727"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","649782601","Here's two more reference: one that looks at the feedback loops in this scenario, and another that talks about why lending is a particularly challenging scenario for fairness mitigation algorithms.

#### [Delayed Impact of Fair Machine Learning (Liu et al. 2018)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/liu18c/liu18c.pdf)
> [Fairness] constraints are clearly intended to protect the disadvantaged group by an appeal to intuition, a rigorous argument to that effect is often lacking.  In  this  work,  we  formally  examine  under  what  circumstances fairness criteria do indeed promote the long-term well-being of disadvantaged groups measured in terms of a temporal  variable  of  interest.   Going  beyond  the  standard classification setting, we introduce a one-step feed-back model of decision-making that exposes how decisions change the underlying population over time... Reflecting on our findings, we argue that careful temporal modeling is necessary in order to accurately evaluate the impact of different fairness criteria on the population. More-over, an understanding of measurement error is important in assessing the advantages of fairness criteria relative to unconstrained selection.

[ml-fairness-gym](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/ml-fairness-gym-tool-for-exploring-long.html) also has a paper and blog post on simulating this.

#### [POTs: Protective Optimization Technologies (Kulynych et al. 2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02711.pdf)
> To be consistent with the fairness literature [77,86], we assume that the target group is interested in getting higher credit ratings (through decrease in false-negatives). This model that postulates the access to credit as beneficial, however, is naïve. Even though the loan-making process that relies on risk-based pricing has economic backing, by definition it implies that the less finanically advantaged people will get more expensive loans. Hence, an intervention that aims at increasing inclusion of disadvantaged populations in the lending process can be seen as an instance of *predatory inclusion*[76,87,88]. Even if it results in lower loan prices in the short term, it can lead to dispossession in the long run.

Also, @MiroDudik my understanding from the discussion today was that this direction seemed more promising to pursue than auto loans (eg, https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/492), but that the group would need more input from partners to describe the deployment context so we could discuss harms and how fairlearn can mitigate them (as described in the new ordering for https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/490).  Let me know if there are other ways I can help! 👍

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","652687755","I think Kevin has pointed out the majority of the issues/clarifications needed between the population this sample represents and the specific deployment context and population. In addition to the ecological validity issues with the real-world use the features and target (e.g., can banks access these variables, are they allowed to use them in decision-making), there may also be construct validity issues. Missing a payment in a given month may not provide a good representation of creditworthiness/risk, as defaulting usually means consecutive missed payments; it may be overly punitive for some users and/or too forgiving for other who may have had other missed payments sprinkled in during the year.

In addition to construct validity, I think the stakeholders’ views on the features that they value may be important to understand given the highly regulated and institutionalized nature of lending practices. One feature that primarily comes to mind is the FICO score if deployment context is in the US since it seems to be heavily relied on for so many different types of credit and loan decision. Would lenders be willing to adopt a model that does not include it or that doesn’t include at least some of the features that the FICO score summarizes (e.g., on-time payments over extended period of time, balances, age of credit)?

As already pointed out, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that in addition to gender, race/ethnicity is another protected variable that may have significant implications for fairness. With certain hiring and lending practices, there is certainly a possibility that an interaction between gender and race that may intensify disparities; e.g., black women may be at a greater disadvantage than white women; both are at a greater disadvantage than white men.

Also, while it makes sense, I was also curious about the specific rationale for selecting equalized odds. Found this interesting blog post, https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/05/07/equality-of-opportunity-in-supervised-learning/, that also highlighted how an equalized odds model relates to max-profit model (no fairness constraints) in terms of what % of the potential profits it achieves (in this example, EO model achieved 80% of potential profits relative to max profit). While we want to maximize fairness, I’m guessing % of potential benefits will be an important “performance” metric for lenders/stakeholders.

Circling back to deployment context, we are entering unprecedented times (kinda) given the mass unemployment and potential global recession, which will have the creditworthiness of many people take a massive hit and influence the general practices of lenders since I believe they tend to have lower interest rates, but more stringent, narrow standards for creditworthiness/ willingness to take on risk. In a perfect world, we would have training data that included the recent-ish 2008 recession and what ensued. Of course (sadly), there is some evidence to suggest that people in underrepresent groups have been disproportionately impacted by unemployment and shut out of the Payment Protection Program for small businesses. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/women-minority-business-owners-paycheck-protection-program-loans/

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","628024583","Thanks for #418 and #419. You're right that we picked them to demonstrate the functionality, and tried to put in a couple of disclaimers to acknowledge that, but we should do it more carefully (and in case of LSAC consider picking a different motivating example altogether). Your critiques make me realize that this was not the best strategy. I wonder about the following approach:
* we may need two styles of notebooks: ""case studies"" and ""functionality demonstrations""
* ""case studies"" should be expected to use real-world data and dig into the sociotechnical context in as many different ways as we can think
* ""functionality demonstrations"" still need to be based on a credible real-world use-case, but they would be shorter and so necessarily more limited in what they can explore. Two ideas how to make this happen: 
  * motivation (e.g., the ML task, fairness considerations, features available) should be developed or at least reviewed by a domain practitioner
  * the example does not need to use real data--in fact it might be better if it uses obviously synthetic data, so as to avoid the issues of why the data was collected in the first place as well as the consent of all the parties involved
  * with the above two bullets (re. motivation and synthetic data), I'd be more comfortable to  provide a generic ""this is just a functionality demonstration, so ..."" disclaimer.

One of the next steps from my side is to work out the ""functionality demonstration"" version of the credit-card lending notebook. It's already semi-synthetic, and we have existing relationship with various financial services customers, so we could get them to review how realistic it is.

Also, of course, if you want to work out your own notebook from scratch and contribute to the repository, it would be great! But especially with case studies, this could be a lot of work--so I wonder whether we should set up more explicit authorship and citation format for such more extended contributions.","2020-05-13 14:24:44","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/413#issuecomment-628024583"

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","646236707","fyi, I think this paper is super interesting: [Extending the Machine Learning Abstraction Boundary:A Complex Systems Approach to Incorporate Societal Context (Martin et al. 2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09663.pdf):
> Machine learning (ML) fairness research tends to focus primarily on mathematically-based interventions on often opaque algorithms or models and/or their immediate inputs and outputs. Such oversimplified mathematical models abstract away the underlying societal context where ML models are conceived, developed, and ultimately deployed...  we outline three new tools to improve the comprehension, identification and representation of societal context.

And here's a key diagram, with a systems dynamics diagram modeling a lending scenario:
<img width=""841"" alt=""Screen Shot 2020-06-18 at 1 02 31 PM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1056957/85051163-26dc3380-b165-11ea-869c-fc628bf9c1cf.png"">

which is of course quite complex :)

My two cents is that it's cool to see ML folks integrating these older lines of work, and it's awesome to see more research on new methods for approaching sociotechnical fairness.  At the same time, the approach of adding more complex formal models to address the ""framing trap"" is a bit of a ""formalism trap"" :)  This approach probably makes it even more challenging for non-technical folks to design, critique or evaluate the system (eg, causal graphical models or systems dynamics models are very challenging for people to create, revise or use).  If the evaluation point included qualitative feedback from non-technical stakeholders, or from people impacted by the ML system, it might focus on really different things.  I find the contrast with plain language and storytelling methods like [Brown et al. (2020)](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/achoulde/files/accountability_final_balanced.pdf) or [Young et al. (2019)](https://techpolicylab.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/TowardInclusiveTechPolicyDesign.pdf) helpful (and I also appreciate how that framing admits the possibilities that the issue may be more about decisions of ML practitioners rather than from deficits in the community members).

To connect this to `fairlearn`, I see this as the kind of thing that would **not** be in a notebook or part of the project, precisely because of the ""formalism trap.""  As an example, I don't think it would have helped improve the conversations today if we had been drawing proper systems dynamics models, as compared to just talking :)  I do think there's an opportunity to add a paragraph about this in an ""alternative approaches"" page, where this tradeoff is highlight in terms of abstraction traps, in a way that's short and accessible for a developer audience who might not recognize this as a ""formalism trap.""","2020-06-18 18:34:47","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/413#issuecomment-646236707"
"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","646476242","Very cool! Of course, I got attracted by the diagram and tried to figure out what's going on there first. My conclusion was that it's really hard to understand, so I very much agree with your analysis :-)

Overall, I think we could focus a lot more on including stakeholders. I wonder what forms this could take. Invite people to hear how they'd feel about a proposed AI system? For me this is mostly about ""how do we engage with non-technical stakeholders in a way that makes this meaningful and understandable?"". So far everyone involved has at least some technical background. Should the goal be to be to get non-technical up to speed to an extent where they can point out gaps in the proposal (not technical details, but assumptions such as ""what feels like fairness?"", forgotten cases or scenarios that occur in real life, lack of centering on a good user experience overall)? 

Perhaps this isn't something that needs to be addressed right away, but it's something I keep thinking about.

I like your suggestion about including a paragraph about your conclusions. I'm struggling to imagine where it would fit well, and how it could be written in a way that's easily understandable. If you already have an idea I'm curious to see/hear what you have in mind, though!

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","646604506","Thanks for sharing, Kevin! I didn't see this paper before. I was actually thinking about the connection between system dynamics and algorithmic fairness as a potential research direction, it's nice to see there's already some work there. I don't think a system dynamics approach would fall into the formalism trap necessarily; IMO the process of getting all the relevant information is much more valuable than the diagram itself. I think systems thinking can be particularly valuable in identifying undesirable reinforcing feedback loops à la weapons of math destruction. I agree that drawing ""proper diagrams"" should not be part of fairlearn though!

I don't think we'll be able to cover *all* relevant aspects of an example in a reasonably concise notebook. So I would probably try to focus on ensuring that the described scenario is reasonably realistic and whether our assumptions regarding the impact of different scenarios are correct. We should make sure that the description of the case, potential harms, and any related trade-offs are clear enough for non-technical folks to have an opinion on them. I think this would be a good goal regardless of whether we're actually able to involve stakeholders.","2020-06-19 12:17:29","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/413#issuecomment-646604506"

@hildeweerts I really agree that this is an awesome line of research, and I'm super glad to see people exploring it!  I really like the Brown et al. (2020) and Young et al. (2019) work as other examples of other ways to engage in those kinds of conversations with a broader range of people.

@romanlutz @hildeweerts Your comments here have super helpful language for framing this work, since I recognize there's a bit of drift in this issue :)  So I think what might be good is to close this issue, and move forward in a more targeted way in the relevant individual issues (eg, https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/492).

This conversation also helped me see that @hildeweerts's comment on:

> We should make sure that the description of the case, potential harms, and any related trade-offs are clear enough for non-technical folks to have an opinion on them

and @romanlutz' question about ""where should this live?"" are a bit related!  I think the other thing I've been implicitly trying to do here is say... *what if Fairlearn was a place developers new to fairness came to get help in learning and doing the work of approaching fairness as a sociotechnical challenge?*  This is in the spirit that @hannawallach mentioned yesterday and @MiroDudik described in https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues/311#issuecomment-592716247.

So to try to help move this forward, but also respect our current bandwidth, I'm going to close this issue out so we can focus on notebook examples.  I'll separately prototype a website that is ""for developers, promoting the idea that fairness as a sociotechnical challenge.""  This is similar to the idea in the [microrubric for critiques](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/490).  That way we reduce the chatter a bit in the short term, and when the timing is right, we can use that prototype website as a concrete thing we can react to and critique and decide what might be good to merge into fairlearn.  👍 ","2020-06-19 15:40:03","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/413#issuecomment-646703267"

Re. industry vs. academia, I'd say that we are looking to enable practitioners (in tech, but also other sectors) to effectively do fairness assessment and mitigation. The field of fair ML is dynamically evolving, so we expect to interact with academic research. Not just the academic research on new algorithms, but also academic research on how practitioners use these algorithms. Some of the people on the Fairlearn team have been involved in that style of research:

It would also move fairlearn towards having a ""developer community"" which I think would be very beneficial and healthy for the project as well.

On the scikit-learn-contrib, I'd be more than happy to have at least one fairness library there, and I think it's about time. But I wouldn't say it's a necessity.

Handling arbitrarily encoded **binary** classification should be doable, but it is more involved than meets the eye, because:
* Fairness criteria / fairness metrics rely on a specific `pos_label` (which is right now a constant=1)
* Our reductions create signed weights and they rely on the fact that the class encoding is the same between the meta-estimator (our wrapper) and base estimator.

For now, I suggest that we enforce/validate that y is valued 0/1 and treat this as a feature request rather than a bug. (After we fix the validation of y!)

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","597078407","@kevinrobinson  Thank you for calling attention to this, I've been working on improving the end-to-end testing in our sibling project, interpretML. The blocking issue had been what you encountered, building the jupyter extension package from the typescript required publishing a version of the dashboard to npm (additionally, the dependence on jupyter extensions prevented pip install -e from working, and it was incompatible with databricks notebooks). The work in interpretML has been to move to a local Flask backend that serves the built static javascript files, which allows for locally testing changes in notebook using pip install local in interactive mode (-e). The plan is to move this architecture into fairlearn when all the issues are worked out (there is an issue with databricks that I'm working on currently). 

As for the mock-data, the idea is we can add new data to validate common use cases quickly without needing to set up the notebook and pip install. I'd love to have better test coverage than this, but in the meantime it provides some valuable validation that common scenarios work. Please feel free to add other scenarios, and we can improve the test-page to use precomputed metric values for a given dataset to replace the random numbers (this works well with the work done by @riedgar-ms for calculating metrics for upload).","2020-03-10 13:13:49","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/322#issuecomment-597078407"

With this it's basically
1. make changes to UX code within `visualizations`
2. run `build_widget.py` with `--use-local-changes` option
3. `pip install .` 
4. validate that it works as intended

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","644742704","@romanlutz ah yeah, I'm aware of that script and the improvements to it, but I think we are talking about slightly different things :)  To try to clarify, let me break the issue into two components, and then connect this to why I brought this up back then, and why I don't think this is worth spending on time on right now.

### a. build_widget workflow
`build_widget` is a production step, it's not optimized for development experience.  On my laptop this takes ~90 seconds, which is slow enough that it impacts the local development workflow.

### b. test app workflow
 There's a `test` folder, which doesn't have tests but a separate JS app that can be used for local development.

Using that approach avoids any Python, but is still configured as a production build so takes almost a minute.  I'm using:
```
% time python scripts/build_widget.py --use-local-changes --yarn-path=/Users/krobinson/.yarn/bin/yarn
(25 seconds)
% cd /visualization/test/test-page
% time yarn add fairlearn-dashboard@""../../FairnessDashboard""
(15 seconds)
% yarn start
(9 seconds)
```

There's also some JS code that mocks the API to Python and provides a mix of static fixture data and randomly generated values.  These randomly generated values is what I'm really trying to get at, and why this is about *end-to-end product development*, and not just about ""how do I run the build.""

### why i brought this up
When I first started looking at this project, I pulled down the repo and started getting it running, and then was looking around the test app.  I was confused because the visualizations weren't semantically meaningful, and then I discovered that the metrics were being randomly generated.  I understand why this tradeoff makes sense, and how it's particularly helpful for iterating on the visual design elements in the UI.

But it also means you can't use the test app to evaluate UX changes, even for a local demo.  So I wrote a script to grab a dataset, compute the metrics and write them out to `__mock_data` and then updated `App.jsx` in the test app to read those.

As I was doing that, I realized that this was too involved for a prototype, and opened this issue :)

---

Anyway, I'm going to close this issue since it's no longer a priority for me, and from what @rihorn2 said above, it sounds like there might be other internal MS considerations like merging with interpretml and maybe other interop required on the Azure side.  It's hard to evaluate any of the engineering tradeoffs here without any context on the product roadmap, but maybe these notes are helpful for the future.

1. defining the constraints, e.g., | E[h(x) | A=a] - E[h(x)] | <= `eps`

See the current documentation:
> `eps`: Allowed fairness constraint violation; the solution `best_classifier` is

I do worry about the community aspect of AIF360 though. IBM seems very protective of their branding and ownership when it comes to the governance of the package, and that may hurt them in the long run (at least it has discouraged me to spend more time on it than I do).

If there were no company politics involved, in an ideal world, I'd be delighted to see a unified effort on a single package with an open governance model. But unfortunately we don't live in that world.

And that's quite aside from the technical differences and that they implement different methods. As the FAT-ML community works on the topic and advancements are made, it'd be nice to have the methods available to a broader community for us to see the feedback, what works, and what doesn't in practice.

Feel free to share on this issue if you know of governance models that you think would work well (as we're starting small, but generate decent community interest).

On a high level, we firmly view fairness as a socio-technical challenge, so we want to provide techniques that enable humans to navigate fairness trade-offs in a manner that makes most sense for their context. Because of this, our package includes not only algorithm and metrics, but also the fairness assessment dashboard--and we hope that the development of UX for fairness assessment / unfairness mitigation will be our key area of contribution.
 
On the unfairness mitigation side, our initial scope is a bit different than AIF360: we are currently only looking at group fairness and have included only three mitigation techniques. However, our techniques are not tied to classification and/or binary sensitive features.

My only issue with your proposal is the name `warm_start`. It's not just that it somewhat mismatches how it's used elsewhere in `sklearn`, it also does not quite match what I'd expect.

I am fine with two options:

* *less preferred*: Always fit the estimator when calling fit on `ThresholdOptimizer` instance. This would drop our old functionality for now, but we can add it back in future.

* *more preferred*: Keep the ability to provide a fitted base estimator, but let's not use `warm_start=True` as a flag, but use some other keyword. I'm happy to use something like `prefitted_estimator=True` or just `prefit=True`. This would be analogous to running `CalibratedClassifierCV` with `cv='prefit'`.

I can think of two reasons why use a prefitted estimator:

* Scale: The base estimator may be fitted on a much larger data set than the threshold optimizer, so we don't want to spend a lot of time on fitting the base estimator over and over if we are only exploring different fairness criteria in the threshold optimizer (such exploration would have to be manual rather than inside `GridSearchCV`). Also, statistically speaking, to get a high-quality threshold optimizer requires much less data than getting the initial high-accuracy predictor.

* Availability: We may only have access to the base estimator, but not to the data it was fitted on, e.g., for data privacy reasons.

Yes, we could do that. We could even keep the `prefit` name in the interest of keeping the names short. However, we need to document that it's only a preference, and even with `prefit=True`, the estimator will do a `fit` on the child estimator.

I'm not opposed to having the `prefit` option, but both of these can be achieved w/o the `prefit` option, using a `FrozenEstimator`. You can see the discussion in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/13288 and my implementation of it here: https://gist.github.com/adrinjalali/de9ac56c61f3931b38b24e577f54d083","2020-02-26 11:57:17","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/308#issuecomment-591389775"

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","587514778","Thanks for catching this--you are right that in those two instances we are using ""accuracy"" in a generic sense rather than the more specific ""accuracy rate"". We are currently revising the wizard, so there will be two steps after the selection of sensitive features:
* Accuracy metric (which we should perhaps rename to ""Error metric""); in this step the user selects any standard metric of model's predictive performance
* Disparity metric (which we might also rename ""Fairness metric"", because we have a few that are not disparities); which would quantify the disparities
The single-model view (Step 3) will no longer have the heading that you currently see (so ""Disparity in accuracy"" will vanish there).

So--I think that we should just change the second step from ""Accuracy metric"" to ""Error metric"". Thoughts?

Given the scope of fairlearn is pretty broad, it does seem like the framing that it chooses to present to users about how to think through fairness questions is probably one of its core competencies, even beyond specific audits or visualizations.

one) and only do comparison of the inner elements of the array.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","578775056","Agreed about improving tests. I don't think that a comparison to the golden value is a bad idea, we should just make sure that our estimator(s) (on top of which we implement the reductions) have a unique minimum. This is easily achieved by adding a bit of regularization.

So my suggestion for a systematic solution:
* use estimators from `test/unit/reductions/exponentiated_gradient/simple_learners.py`
* modify those estimators, so they can have a bit of regularization

I prefer this to using estimators from sklearn.linear_model--these allow regularization, so we could solve the uniqueness problem there too--but I'd prefer to avoid sklearn dependence in tests like these (we could even try to avoid numpy, but I'm not that paranoid).","2020-01-27 14:31:57","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/265#issuecomment-578775056"

The problem that the `.dev[n]` suffix is solving (and I believe it [can be combined with RC](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#public-version-identifiers)) is that PyPI doesn't separate 'upload' from 'publish'. I always want to push exactly the same changeset to Test PyPI and PyPI, and that merging of upload and publish means that we can 'burn' versions in Test PyPI.

Suppose we don't have the `.dev[n]` mechanism, and we're trying to release v1.0.0. This gets to Test-PyPI and we have a problem. So we fix it. But now, we can't release v1.0.0 to Test-PyPI again... we have to go with v1.0.1. And that's the version which will ultimately go to PyPI itself. In a nutshell, the version released to PyPI depends on the number of issues we found at the Test-PyPI stage.

So by dynamically adding `.dev[n]` to the Test-PyPI versions (where `n` is specified at the time the release is created) we can bypass this.

I'm not sure why you need to upload to `test.pypi` to run the tests. The artifacts can be created and tested in the same pipeline w/o having to upload them anywhere. Another solution is if you really need a staging area, you can do what the scipy ecosystem does, which is to upload them somewhere else first. We used to have an account on rackspace, and have moved now to anaconda.org. You can check this org to see how it looks and see the files we're uploading there: https://anaconda.org/scipy-wheels-nightly . We also upload our nightly builds on that repo and give instructions on how to install the nightly from there on our website.

Regarding the `dev[n]`, you can do `rc[n]` instead, which is what we do as well. In worst case scenario, if there's a very minor issue in your release and you'd like to fix it, you can release a `.post[n]` version. We had to do it in our latest release since we forgot to exclude some `.c` files from the wheel.","2020-04-03 11:28:07","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/258#issuecomment-608382183"

Burning versions there is what prompted the `dev[n]` workaround. The key point (as you note) is to test the actual package, well apart from the repo.

Side note: I did have Test-PyPI have `rc[n]` for a while, but decided to change to `dev[n]` since that's ""less significant"" and can actually be combined with `rc[n]`.

I do want to avoid something that happened to one of our dependencies (specifically, _nested_ dependencies, so hunting it down wasn't fun) a few months ago, where in the morning they release v4.0.0 .... and by the end of the day, they were up to v4.0.4 and finally managed to get it right.

The way the perf tests are set up right now is that you wouldn't run them locally anyway since that will take ages. So you really need some sort of cluster that takes care of it. We've chosen AzureML since it's the easiest option for us, but in theory you could plug in whatever you like. `tempeh` supports `azureml-sdk` right now, but you can feel free to add whatever other platforms you prefer.

We don't take a stand on what kind of fairness criteria is the right one. In fact, we quite explicitly say that fairness is a sociotechnical challenge, and every situation will require close examination by domain experts to figure out what makes sense. Group fairness is just one lens of assessing/mitigating unfairness, and often more tractable than individual fairness. That doesn't mean we want to discourage people from using other kinds.

- you are running a jupyter notebook
- you fit a mitigated estimator in one jupyter cell, it takes a while, but completes without any issues
- in the next jupyter cell, you call predict on the fitted estimator, but there is a bug in printing some kind of a statistic on the predictions
- you fix the bug and re-run the cell, but if the predictions are different, you cannot be quite sure whether you fixed the bug (which was somewhere in calculating the summary of predictions)

More generally--whenever there is any kind of a pipeline or additional processing / analysis done after you fit an estimator, I think that you would may want to replicate the behavior on the level of ""predict"". Debugging is one use case. Comparison of two strategies for postprocessing predictions might be another use case.

IMHO passing the rng or a seed to predict is pretty dangerous and may end up with people using it in a way they really shouldn't.

In the scenario you mention, you can still go back and re-run the whole pipeline and get the same result, if you could set the rng at the estimator level, and if you want to re-run a predict, you can set the seed from outside the estimator to force the re-run of the same path.

In contrast to your proposed API, if users set the rng at the estimator level, they will get two different outputs if they call `predict` on the same input, and still they have the reproducibility guarantees.

Also, note that not exposing the rng through the `__init__` doesn't mean it's really random. It means if the user needs to reproduce their results, they should set the global `numpy` seed or whichever rng you use internally in the estimator.","2020-01-23 16:47:42","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/243#issuecomment-577767781"

How about this. Let's go with the `sklearn` convention, i.e., the `random_state` passed in `__init__`. If we ever need the reproducibility on the `predict` level, we can just explicitly reset the random seed on the rng being used.

My question is, how do we present them in a way that is clear and actionable. An example of one potential implementation (using the MetricFrame, though you could imagine this being woven into the plots as well) is below. 


**Wilson bounds** 
(@LeJit and Duncan)

```
def wilson(p, n, z = z_score):
    denominator = 1 + z**2/n
    centre_adjusted_probability = p + z*z / (2*n)
    adjusted_standard_deviation = np.sqrt((p*(1 - p) + z*z / (4*n)))/np.sqrt(n)
    lower_bound = (centre_adjusted_probability - z*adjusted_standard_deviation) / denominator
    upper_bound = (centre_adjusted_probability + z*adjusted_standard_deviation) / denominator
    return (lower_bound, upper_bound)
```
   
Using the above, you could then define functions for each bound, for a specific metric, and pass that into the metric frame. 

```
The output of the Metric Frame using mock data with race and gender as sensitive features, and a z-score of 1.96 (p-value of 0.05) 
```

The issue with the above is that MetricFrame will run into issues with equality and difference operators

Yes. In fairlearn paper, the loss is  `err(Q) + DP`, and the `err(Q)` is the misclassification error.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","579967910","@romanlutz I looked at `_pmf_predict` in Exponentiated Gradient. I have a question on how the predictions from the returned classifiers are combined to get predicted probabilities.

**Current**
In `_mean_pred`[function](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/blob/master/fairlearn/reductions/_exponentiated_gradient/exponentiated_gradient.py#L17), the approach taken is to  call `predict` and then weight the result. This does not pass on the 'full uncertainty information' from the classifiers. As `predict` only returns 0 or 1 instead of probabilities. Encountered this in an example where the `_classifiers` had only one classifier. Then, the result from `_pmf_predict` had only 0s and 1s which is what `predict` returns. This is an issue.

**Alternative**
Instead, one can call `predict_proba` for each classifier and then weight. In expectation, the results should be same i.e. expectation of the two variables `weight*Bernoulli(prob)` and `Bernoulli(weight*prob)` is `weight*prob`.

Is this a better way for getting predicted probabilities? Trying it on the [notebook example](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/blob/master/notebooks/Mitigating%20Disparities%20in%20Ranking%20from%20Binary%20Data.ipynb) seem to give better AUC and disparity values. Did not do a thorough test.

    score = pred_all.dot(algorithm._expgrad_result._weights)

    return score

1. Sample weights should be only applied to the error metric, but not the fairness metric. The use case: such sample weights allow for varying misclassification costs on a per-example basis. However, the fairness metrics (such as demographic parity) are still standard.

2. Sample weights apply to both the error metric and the fairness metric. Here, a natural use case is covariate shift. For example, the data might be collected iid according to some data collection distribution, but we would like to minimize the error and disparity under some target distribution. The weights would then correspond to the ratios between the target and the data collection probabilities.

More precisely, if the weight of an example is W, you can resample it with the probability cW where c is chosen for the whole data set, so that the probability is never larger than 1. This may substantially shrink your data size. If you're okay increasing your data size, you can also resample the data using something that looks more like ""randomized rounding"". You can pick a scaling constant s, and then first replicate the example floor(sW) times, and then include one more copy of the example with the probability prob=sW-floor(sW).

When it returns a number between 0 and 1, it should be interpreted as the probability with which the decision maker should assign class 1, so the sampling that @MatthijsdeJ describes is the correct thing to do.

The number that it returns should **not be interpreted** as the probability that the example belongs to class 1. That's why thresholding at 0.5 is not justified. The actual reason for randomization is to enable the full range of accuracy / fairness tradeoffs. Randomization can also help mitigate unfairness without affecting accuracy: for example by randomizing between two classifiers that have the same accuracy, but differ in which of the subpopulation they put at an advantage it is possible to improve fairness without affecting accuracy.

In practice, it can be desirable to use deterministic classifiers. In that case, you can look at  `result.classifiers` to check whether any of them works.

But, it's a good idea to provide a more informative error message. Also,
maybe at some point in future, it might be nice to have wrapper that would
convert a standard (non-weighted) learner into a weighted learner.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","744755141","@violazhong @riedgar-ms and I discussed this earlier today. Capturing some of our notes.

The most important aspect of this work is passing in the resampling method. @riedgar-ms pointed out that this should probably be in the constructor or the `fit` method. Since we're passing the `estimator` in the constructor that seems to be the most suitable place IMO. Once we have that on the object we'd have to replace this line https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/blob/d1581b4576fa5c4dbb0fb99bf5548c74ba05b0ac/fairlearn/reductions/_exponentiated_gradient/_lagrangian.py#L178
with something like this (pardon the pseudocode at times):
```
if estimator has fit function and fit function has sample_weight arg:
     estimator.fit(self.X, redY, **{self.sample_weight_name: redW})
elif user has provided resampling_method:
     resampled_X, resampled_Y = resampling_method(X, redY, redW)
     estimator.fit(resampled_X, resampled_Y)
else:
    raise exception and describe that we need sample_weight arg or resampling_method
```

I see a few different ways to do the resampling. I'm sure there are way more complicated ones as well.

### deterministic and keeping the same size
- scale weights so that the sum of all weights is equal to the number of rows in X
- add floor(scaled_weight) samples of each row to a new resampled dataset, e.g. if rescaled_weight=2.7 -> add 2
- order the residuals, so for our 2.7 that would be 0.7
- fill the remaining slots up starting from the largest residuals

Example:
```
dataset = [s1,s2,s3,s4,s5]
weights = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_weights = [1/3, 2/3, 1, 4/3, 5/3]
add one of samples s3, s4, and s5, then order residuals:
[1/3, 2/3, 0, 1/3, 2/3]
We have two slots left so those would go to samples s2 and s5 with the final resampled dataset:
[s3,s4,s5,s2,s5] (ordering doesn't matter)
```

### deterministic but not keeping the same size
- find smallest weight
- scale all weights up so that min = 1
- take `floor(weight)` and replicate each sample that many times

Example:
```
dataset = [s1,s2,s3,s4,s5]
weights = [0.1, 0.29, 1.3, 3.41, 9.54]
scaled_weights = [1, 2.9, 13, 34.1, 95.4]
final data set has s1 x 1, s2 x 2, s3 x 13, s4 x 34, s5 x 95
```
Of course, using `floor` is quite arbitrary here. This could just as well be cutting off at <0.5.

"https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn","issue_comment","757035577","[Edited. I think that my original sampling suggestion wasn't actually more sample efficient than the deterministic approach.]

I'm sorry--I'm a bit late to the discussion.

The deterministic strategy above would not be my first choice, because it's less sample efficient than the following randomized strategy guaranteed to always generate N data points:
* Rescale the weights so that they sum to N; let w_i be the rescaled weights.
* From each original data point i, deterministically generate floor(w_i) examples.
* Let w’_i = w_i-floor(w_i). Let N’ = sum_i w’_i (this is the number of examples that we still need to generate).
* Represent each example i by a line segment of length w'_i and put them all next to each other on a numerical axis, with the first line segment beginning at zero and the last line segment ending at N'.
* Draw N' numbers independently uniformly from [0,N'] and generate examples corresponding to where these numbers land on the numerical axis.

By the way, by sample-efficient I mean: how large N do you need to guarantee that a resampling wrapper (applied to a sample-weights-unaware learning algorithm) returns a model that's epsilon-close to the model that optimizes the weighted objective.

What are the benefits of a deterministic strategy over randomized? One that I can think of is reproducibility, but that can be handled by a random seed.

Re. API for the wrapper, I was thinking about something like:
```python
class Resampler(BaseEstimator):
    def __init__(self, estimator, random_state=None, n=None): 
    ...
    
    def fit(self, X, y, sample_weights=None, **kwargs):
    ...
```
If `n=None`, it just means that the data set of the same size as provided will be generated. We could also describe the data set size by specifying a scaling factor relative to the provided data (and default to 1).","2021-01-08 22:46:01","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/4#issuecomment-757035577"

Yes. The least squares classifier is used only as an example (to make test_fairlearn.py deterministic and free of dependencies), but in fact it is only a toy example.

You should be able to directly use any sklearn-style learner as long as it provides ""fit"" (with weights) and ""predict"" methods.

For example, our paper was using the learners
sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression(C=0.01)
sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier(learning_rate=0.25,n_estimators=150,random_state=101)

You can just replace LeastSquaresLearner() in test_fairlearn.py with any of these or your own.

I would guess the easiest way to ensure these are proper is to pass `dtype={…}`, _e.g._:

```python
data_frame.pg_copy_to(
    'aequitas_group',

    dtype={

`data_frame.drop(data_frame.columns[[#fill with col numbers that need to be removed]], axis=1, inplace=True)

Another way to remove null values is to use Pandas dataframe dropna( ) function

`new_data_frame = data_frame.dropna()`

doing this will return a new dataframe with the rows/cols with Null/NaN values removed.

Perhaps and/or: look for a database URI in the process environment, and only fall back to checking a config file, (either the existing config or if also desired a separate database-specific config file). 

The process environment allows for the most flexibility – (you can even still use a secrets file of some kind if you like, and either manually or automatically load it into your environment) – and that interface can help encourage safe-keeping of secrets, (whereas expecting files on disk containing secrets encourages the reverse).

As a first step, would we want two matrices one with distance measured in the feature space and a second with distance measured in the outcome space (from which we could determine a score such as what fraction of the pairs of points fail the conditions)?

Similarly, would the input be the whole feature space for a prediction? This seems necessary, but undesirable, since we would require all the data.","2018-10-01 06:04:42","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/48#issuecomment-425798308"

Thanks for checking out the work. Here we only have implementations for 1 actually. We didn't include the implementations for 2-4 because these are all open source packages that can be used. The key new contribution of our work is the IOFP algorithm, so we assumed (probably wrongly) that people can find the implementations of the other methods publicly. For example, 3-4 come from the sklearn package.  For 2 (mRMR) there is this: https://github.com/fbrundu/pymrmr. 

We will be revamping this repo in about a month with significant updates that will include 2-4 as interfaces as well for replication.  Our updates will clear up this confusion. Happy to answer more questions.

"https://github.com/adebayoj/fairml","issue_comment","286227195","@afiodorov  thanks for taking a look at the code and for your feedback. 

1) you are right. with the constant-zero and median strategies, the loop is redundant. I plan on separating the direct perturbation code from overall method to make it so that the run is independent. I am testing a local branch atm that handles this. Will push a fix up later this wk. 

2) The purpose of direction perturbation. This is also a good question, and you are right, it is not explained in the thesis. We are working on suitable documentation to fully explain the overall issue. 

For now here is the justification for including direction perturbation: if you have a function f(x_1, x_2, x_2). What, fairml does on a high level is to give you the dependence of f on each of the x_i. Now the dependence is calculated as direct influence + indirect influence.  For direct influence, we generate a data transformation using any of the different direct perturbation strategies and then look at the impact of the black-box function on that perturbation. For the indirect influence, we use orthogonal transformation to generate those transformations. 

Certainly, we could just use orthogonal transformation on all variables including, but wanted to give people flexibility to pick whatever function that they are interested in using for this task. Hope this helps explain the use of the direct-perturbation strategy requirement.

Sorry if this has caused you problems, we just haven't got any datasets in EthicML where we do multi-class classification so we haven't really thought about it very much. That said, it is something I want us to do right - FairML work in general is far too focussed on binary classification problems. Do you have a dataset that we should add? (I understand that this is a long shot - datasets are not so open)

You a good point about the confusion matrix based metrics. One option is for the user to specify the label values, but as this is a property of the dataset, it would be nice if this information could be taken from there directly.

If you'd like to open a PR, you're more than welcome. Alternatively I will try to address this. Looking through the tests, we don't have enough that use the `non_binary_toy` dataset.

"https://github.com/predictive-analytics-lab/EthicML","issue_comment","1010705666","Hi @olliethomas,

I looked into this further and found that the `metric_per_sensitive_attribute` method creates a subset of the dataset. This subset has fewer rows than the actual dataset. Here, the number of unique labels differ, it gets reduced. This results in the `LabelOutOfBounds` Error or `ValueError`. The method definition is at https://github.com/predictive-analytics-lab/EthicML/blob/main/ethicml/metrics/per_sensitive_attribute.py#L23

The error that you are seeing was due to the possible target values being inferred from the dataset. 

There are actually two solutions to this.

The first, I've added in #489 - which is the option to define the labels for a metric. so `em.TPR(pos_class=1)` becomes `em.TPR(pos_class=1, labels=[0,1,2])`. This new parameter has the default value of `None`, and when `None` is passed, the default behaviour of inferring the labels remains.

The second solution is probably closer to what most users want to do. The problem is the `s` definition from the block 
```
true_data=em.DataTuple(x=pd.DataFrame(data['sepal length (cm)']),
                       s=pd.DataFrame(data['sepal length (cm)']),
                       y=pd.DataFrame(data['target']))
```
What is happening here is that the protected attribute, `s`, is being set to a float where the number of unique `s`-values is, in this case, 35. The number of unique `y`-values is 3.
Given that the dataset is 150 samples, the chance of all targets being present in every unique s-group is low.

In the case of the notebook - if you set the sensitive attribute to some binary value, then everything works without having to define the labels.
```
true_data=em.DataTuple(x=pd.DataFrame(data['sepal length (cm)']),
                       s=pd.DataFrame(np.random.randint(0,2,size=(len(data), 1)), columns=[""s""]),
                       y=pd.DataFrame(data['target']))
```

Hopefully this solve the issue for now - we'll make a new release soon. If I've misunderstood, or this doesn't solve the problem, please let me know. Thanks again.","2022-01-12 12:39:09","https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/issues/431#issuecomment-1011004347"

"https://github.com/predictive-analytics-lab/EthicML","issue_comment","674013604","Developing this further, the mapping could be specified like this:

```python
class SensSpec(NamedTuple):
    """"""Specification for a sensitive attribute.""""""

    multiplier: int
    columns: List[str]


def adult_sex_race() -> Dataset:
    s_mapping = {
        ""race"": SensSpec(multiplier=1, columns=[
            ""race_Amer-Indian-Eskimo"",
            ""race_Asian-Pac-Islander"",
            ""race_Black"",
            ""race_Other"",
            ""race_White"",
        ]),
        ""sex"": SensSpec(multiplier=5, columns=[""Sex_Male""]),
    }
    return Dataset(
        name=""Adult, race-sex"",
        # ...
        s_mapping=s_mapping,
    )
```

Then, `Dataset.load()` would do something like this:

```python
def load(self):
    # ...
    s = pd.DataFrame(np.zeros())
    for _, spec in self.s_mapping.items():
        values = undo_one_hot(all_data[spec.columns])
        s += spec.multiplier * values
    # ...
```

The `undo_one_hot()` is needed in order to combine all relevant columns into one number which we can then multiply with the multiplier.

The inverse mapping is a bit trickier.

```python
def undo_s_mapping(s: pd.Series, s_mapping: Dict[str, SensSpec]):
    final_df = {}
    for sens, spec in s_mapping.items():
        value = (s % (spec.multiplier + 1)) // spec.multiplier
        restored = one_hot(value)
        restored.columns = spec.columns
        final_df[sens] = restored  # for the multi-level column index

    return pd.concat(final_df, axis=1)

"https://github.com/predictive-analytics-lab/EthicML","issue_comment","464089748","More info on Parquet:

> Parquet is designed to faithfully serialize and de-serialize `DataFrame` s, supporting all of the pandas dtypes, including extension dtypes such as datetime with tz.

> Several caveats.

> * Duplicate column names and non-string columns names are not supported.
> * Index level names, if specified, must be strings.
> * Categorical dtypes can be serialized to parquet, but will de-serialize as `object` dtype.
> * Non supported types include `Period` and actual Python object types. These will raise a helpful error message on an attempt at serialization.
